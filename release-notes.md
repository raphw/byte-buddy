- Added methods for reading inner classes of a `TypeDescription`.
- Fixed random naming based on random numbers to avoid signed numbers.
- Moved `Nexus` and `Installer` types to a package-level to avoid illegal outer and inner class references which could be resolved eagerly.
- Added validation for illegal constant pool entries.

- Fixed class validator which did not allow `<clinit>` blocks in interface types.
- Added restriction to retransformation to not attempt a retransformation at all if no class should be retransformed.
- Added a factory for creating an `Implementation.Context` that is configurable. This way, it is possible to avoid a rebase of a type initializer which is not always possible.

- Fixed resolution for modifiers of members that are defined by Byte Buddy. Previously, Byte Buddy would sometimes attempt to define private synthetic methods on generated interfaces.
- Fixed assignability resolution for arrays.
- Fixed class file parser which would not recognize outer classes for version 1.3 byte code.

### 6. October 2015: version 0.7 (release candidate 3)

- Changed modifiers for accessor methods and rebased methods to be public when rebasing or accessing methods of a Java 8 interface. For interfaces, all modifiers must be public, even for such synthetic members.
- Support absolute path names for accessing class file resources of the `ByteArrayClassLoader`.
- Added random suffix to the names of rebased methods to avoid naming conflicts.

### 16. September 2015: version 0.7 (release candidate 2)

### 17. July 2015: version 0.6.13

- Fixed resolution of field accessors to not attempt reading of non-static fields from static methods.
- Fixed renaming strategy for type redefinitions to work around a constraint of ASM where stack map frames required to be expanded even though this was not strictly necessary.

- Previous version 0.6.9 contained another bug when attempting to fix this problem.

Corrected incorrect deployment of version 0.6.7 which does not use a dependency reduced POM for the *byte-buddy* module.

### 1. June 2015: version 0.6.8 (and 0.6.7)

- Upgraded ASM dependency to 5.0.4.
- Fixed OSGi headers in all relevant artifacts.

*Warning*: The *byte-buddy* artifact of version 0.6.7 is accidentally deployed with a defect POM file which does not exclude the shaded resources.

- Extended `@Origin` annotation to allow for accepting modifiers.

### 29. April 2015: version 0.6.3

- Made the `TypeDescription.ForLoadedType` class loader agnostic. Before, a class that was loaded by multiple class
  loaders would have been considered inequal what is not true for the byte code level.

### 23. April 2015: version 0.6.2

- Added additional class validation such that it becomes impossible to define members on classes that do not fit
  the class's structure, i.e. default methods on Java interfaces in version seven.
- Added default `Assigner` singleton.

- Added possibility to write parameter meta information to created classes if it is fully available for a method.

### 20. March 2015: version 0.5.5

- Retrofitted method parameters to be represented by `ParameterDescription`s and added possibility to extract names
  and modifiers for these parameters, either by using the Java 8 API (if available) or by reading this information
  from the underlying class file.
- Fixed a `NullPointerException` being thrown due to accidental return of a `null` value from a method.

### 15. March 2015: version 0.5.4

- Fixed missing retention of method annotations of instrumented types.
- Allowed dynamic lookup of methods for the `MethodCall` instrumentation.

### 24. February 2015: version 0.5.3

- Changed the `SuperMethodCall` instrumentation to fall back to a default method call if required. A different
  behavior was found to surprise users and would introduce subtle bugs in user code as the super method instrumentation
  would always work with subclassing due to Java super method call semantics.
- Added a `MethodCall` instrumentation that allows hard-coding a method call.
- Added an `InvokeDynamic` instrumentation that allows runtime dispatching by bootstrap methods.
- Fixed the default `TypePool` to retain generic signatures in order to avoid that agents delete such signatures.

### 18. January 2015: version 0.5.2

- Fixed a bug where interface generation would result in a `NullPointerException`.
- Added additional `ElementMatcher`s that allow to identify class loaders.

### 5. December 2014: version 0.5.1

Added the `andThen` method to the `SuperMethodCall` instrumentation in order to allow for a more convenient
executingTransformer interception where a hard-coded super method call is required by the Java verifier.

### 3. December 2014: version 0.5

- Added the `DeclaringTypeResolver` as a component in the default chain which selects the most specific method out
  of two. This is mainly meant to avoid the accidental matching of the methods that are declared by the `Object` type.
- Added `TypeInitializer`s in order to allow `Instrumentation`s to define type initializer blocks.
- Replaced the `MethodMatcher` API with the `ElementMatcher` API which allows for a more sophisticated matching DSL.
- Added a `ClassLoadingStrategy` for Android in its own module.
- Introduced an `AgentBuilder` API and implementation.

### 26. November 2014: version 0.4.1

- Refactored the implementation of the `VoidAwareAssigner` which would otherwise cause unexpected behavior in its
  default state.
- Added a missing boxing instruction to the `InvocationHandlerAdapter`.

### 18. November 2014: version 0.4

- Extended `Instrumentation.Context` to support field accessors.
- Added the `TypePool` abstraction and added a default implementation.
- Refactored annotations to have an intermediate form as `AnnotationDescription` which does not need to
  represent loaded values.
- Refactored several built-in `Instrumentation`, among others, all implementations now support `TypeDescription`
  in addition to loaded `Class` as their arguments
- Added several annotations that apply to the `MethodDelegation`.

### 19. September 2014: version 0.3.1

- Added support for optionally specifying a `ProtectionDomain` for the built-in `ClassLoadingStrategy` implementations.
- Fixed a bug in the resolution of resources of the `ByteArrayClassLoader` and its child-first implementation.

- Added support for type redefinition and type rebasing.
- Added support for accessing a JVM's HotSwap features and a Java agent.
- Added latent a child-first `ClassLoadingStrategy` and manifest versions of the `WRAPPER` and `CHILD_FIRST` default
  class loading strategies.

### 20. June 2014: version 0.2.1

- Added proper support for defining class initializers. Added support for field caching from method instrumentations,
mainly for allowing the reuse of `Method` instances for the `@Origin` annotation and the `InvocationHandlerAdapter`.

### 16. June 2014: version 0.2

 - Changed the semantics of the `@SuperCall` to be only bindable, if a super method can be invoked. Before, an
   exception was thrown if only a non-existent or abstract super method was found.
 - Added features for the interaction with Java 8 default methods. Refactored method lookup to extract invokable
   default methods.
 - Refactored the invocation of super methods to be created by an `Instrumentation.Target`. For a future release,
   this hopefully allows for class redefinitions using today's API for creating subclasses.
 - Upgraded to ASM 5.0.3.

### 02. May 2014: version 0.1

- First general release.
