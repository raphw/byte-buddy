<h2>Why runtime code generation?</h2>

<p>
    The Java language comes with a comparatively strict type system. Java requires all variables and objects to be of a
    specific type and any attempt to assign incompatible types always causes an error. These errors are usually
    emitted by the Java compiler or at the very least by the Java runtime when casting a type illegally. Such strict
    typing is often desirable, for example when writing business applications. Business domains can usually be described
    in such an explicit manner where any domain item represents its own type. This way, we can use Java to build very
    readable and robust applications where mistakes are caught close to their source. Among other things, it is
    Java's type system that is responsible for Java's popularity in enterprise programming.
</p>

<p>
    However, by enforcing its strict type system, Java imposes limitations that restrict the language's
    scope in other domains. For example, when writing a general-purpose library that is to be used by other
    Java applications, we are normally not able to reference any type that is defined in the user's application
    because these types are unknown to us when our library is compiled. In order to call methods or to access
    fields of the user's unknown code, the Java Class Library comes with a reflection API. Using the reflection
    API, we are able to introspect unknown types and to call methods or access fields. Unfortunately, the use of
    the reflection API has two significant downsides:
</p>

<ul class="colored-list padded">
    <li><span>
        Using the reflection API is
        <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html">slower</a> than a hard-coded method
        invocation: First, one needs to perform a rather expensive method lookup to get hold of an object that
        describes a specific method. And when a method is invoked, this requires the JVM to run native code
        which requires long run time compared to a direct invocation. However, modern JVMs know a concept called
        <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/buck/entry/inflation_system_properties">inflation</a> where the
        JNI-based method invocation is replaced by generated byte code that is injected into a dynamically
        created class. (Even the JVM itself uses code generation!) After all, Java's inflation system
        remains with the drawback of generating very general code that for example only works with boxed primitive
        types such that the performance drawback is not entirely settled.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        The reflection API defeats type-safety: Even though the JVM is capable of invoking code by reflection, the
        reflection API is itself not type-safe. When writing a library, this is not a problem as long as we do not
        need to expose the reflection API to the library's user. After all, we do not know the user code during
        compilation and could not validate our library code against its types. Sometimes, it is however required to
        expose the reflection API to a user by for example letting a library invoke one of our own methods for us.
        This is where using the reflection API becomes problematic as the Java compiler would have all the information
        to validate our program's type safety. For example, when implementing a library for method-level security,
        a user of this library would want the library to invoke a method only after enforcing a security constraint.
        For this, the library would need to reflectively call a method after the user handed over the required
        arguments for this method. Doing so, there is however no longer a compile-time type check if these method
        arguments match with the method's reflective invocation. The method call is still validated but the check is
        delayed until runtime. Doing so, we voided a great feature of the Java programming language.
    </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
    This is where runtime code generation can help us out. It allows us to emulate some features that are normally
    only accessible when programming in a dynamic languages without discarding Java's static type checks. This way,
    we can get the best of both worlds and additionally improve runtime performance. To get a better understanding
    of this problem, let us look at the example of implementing the mentioned method-level security library.
</p>

<h4>Writing a security library</h4>

<p>
    Business applications can grow large and sometimes it is difficult to keep an overview of call stacks
    in our application. This can become problematic when we have crucial methods in our application that should
    only be called under specific conditions. Imagine a business application that implements a reset
    functionality that allows deleting everything from the application's database.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class Service {
  void deleteEverything() {
    // delete everything ...
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    Such a reset should of course only be performed by administrators and never by a normal user of our
    application. By analyzing our source code, we could of course make sure that this will never happen. However,
    we can expect our application to grow and to be changed in the future. Therefore, we want to implement
    a tighter security model where the method invocation is guarded by an explicit check for the application's
    current user. We will normally use a security framework for making sure that the method is never called by
    anybody but by an administrator.
</p>

<p>
    For this purpose, assume that we are using a security framework with a public API as the following:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@interface Secured {
  String user();
}

class UserHolder {
  static String user;
}

interface Framework {
  &lt;T&gt; T secure(Class&lt;T&gt; type);
}
</pre>

<p>
    In this framework, the <code>Secured</code> annotation should be used to mark methods that can only be
    accessed by a given user. The <code>UserHolder</code> is used for globally defining which user is
    currently logged into the application. The <code>Framework</code> interface allows for the creation of
    secured instances by calling the default constructor of a given type. Of course, this framework is overly
    simple, but in principal this is how security frameworks like for example the popular
    <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/">Spring Security</a> work. A feature of this
    security framework is that we preserve the user's types. By the contract of our framework interface, we
    promise the user to return an instance of any type <code>T</code> it receives. Thanks to this,
    a user is able to interact with his own types as if the security framework did not exist. In a test
    environment, a user could even create unsecured instances of his types and use these instances instead of the
    secured ones. You will agree that this is really handy! Such frameworks are known to interact with
    <i>POJOs</i>, plain old Java objects, a term that was coined for describing non-intrusive frameworks that do
    not impose their own types upon their users.
</p>

<p>
    Imagine for now that we knew that the type handed to the <code>Framework</code> could only be <code>T =
    Service</code> and that the <code>deleteEverything</code> method was annotated with
    <code>@Secured("ADMIN")</code>. This way, we could easily implement a secured version of this particular type by
    simply subclassing it:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class SecuredService extends Service {
  @Override
  void deleteEverything() {
    if(UserHolder.user.equals("ADMIN")) {
      super.deleteEverything();
    } else {
      throw new IllegalStateException("Not authorized");
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    With this additional class we could implement the framework as follows:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class HardcodedFrameworkImpl implements Framework {
  @Override
  public &lt;T&gt; T secure(Class&lt;T&gt; type) {
    if(type == Service.class) {
      return (T) new SecuredService();
    } else {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown: " + type);
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    Of course, this implementation is not of much use. By the <code>secure</code> method's signature we suggested
    that the method can provide security for any type but in reality, we will throw an exception once we encounter
    something else then the known <code>Service</code>. Also, this would require our security library to know
    about this particular <code>Service</code> type when the library is compiled. Obviously, this is not a
    feasible solution for implementing the framework. So how can we solve this problem? Well, since this is a
    tutorial on a code generation library you will have guessed the answer: We create a subclass on demand
    and at runtime when the <code>Service</code> class first becomes known to our security framework by the
    invocation of the <code>secure</code> method. With code generation, we can take any given type, subclass it at
    runtime and override the methods we want to secure. In our case, we override all methods that are annotated
    with <code>@Secured</code> and read the required user from the annotation's <code>user</code> property. Many
    popular Java frameworks are implemented using a similar approach.
</p>

<h4>General information</h4>

<p>
    Before we learn all about code generation and Byte Buddy, note that you should use code generation with
    care. Java types are something rather special to the JVM and are often not garbage collected. Therefore, you
    should never overuse code generation but only solve problems using generated code when it is the only way
    out. However, if you need to enhance unknown types as in the previous example, code generation is most likely your
    only option. Frameworks for security, transaction management, object-relational mapping or mocking are typical
    users of code generation libraries.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, Byte Buddy is not the first library for code generation on the JVM. However, we believe that Byte Buddy
    knows some tricks the other frameworks cannot apply. The overall objective of Byte Buddy is to work declaratively,
    both by focusing on its domain specific language and the use of annotations. No other code generation library for
    the JVM we know of works this way. Nevertheless, you might want to have a look at some other frameworks for code
    generation to find out which one suites you best. Among others, the following libraries are prevalent in the Java
    space:
</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal padded">
    <dt>
        <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html">Java proxies</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        The Java Class Library comes with a proxy toolkit that allows for the creation of classes that implement a given
        set of interfaces. This built-in proxy supplier is handy but also very limited. The above mentioned security
        framework could for example not be implemented this way since we want to extend classes and not interfaces.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        <a href="http://cglib.sourceforge.net/">cglib</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        The <i>code generation library</i> was implemented during the early years of Java and it did unfortunately not
        keep up with the development of the Java platform. Nevertheless, cglib remains a quite powerful library but its
        active development became rather vague. For this reason, many of its users moved away from cglib.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        <a href="http://www.csg.ci.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~chiba/javassist/">Javassist</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        This library comes with a compiler that takes strings containing Java source code which are translated into Java
        byte code during the runtime of an application. This is very ambitious and in principle a great idea since Java
        source code is obviously a great way for describing Java classes. However, the Javassist compiler does not
        compare to the javac compiler in its functionality and allows for easy mistakes when dynamically composing
        strings to implement more complex logic. Additionally, Javassist comes with a proxy library which is similar to
        the JCL's proxy utilities but allows extending classes and is not limited to interfaces. The scope of
        Javassist's proxy tools remain however equally limited in its API and functionality.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
    Evaluate the frameworks for yourself but we believe that Byte Buddy offers functionality and convenience that you
    will otherwise search in vain. Byte Buddy comes with an expressive domain specific language that allows for the
    creation of very custom runtime classes by writing plain Java code and by using strong typing for your own code.
    At the same time, Byte Buddy is very open for customization and does not restrain you to the features that come out
    of the box. If required, you can even define custom byte code for any implemented method. But even without knowing
    what byte code is or how it works, you are able to do quite a lot without digging deep into the framework. Did
    you for example have a look at the <a data-ng-href="#helloworld"><code>Hello World!</code> example</a>? Using Byte
    Buddy is that easy.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, a pleasant API is not the only feature to consider when choosing a code generation library. For many
    applications, the runtime characteristics of generated code is more likely to determine a best choice. And beyond
    the runtime of the generated code itself, the runtime for creating a dynamic class can also be a concern. Claiming
    that <i>We are the fastest!</i> is as easy as it is hard to provide a valid metric for a library's speed. Still, we
    want to provide such a metric as a basic orientation. However, keep in mind that these results do not necessarily
    translate to your more specific use case where you should rather conduct an individual metric.
</p>

<p>
    Before discussing our metric, let us look at the raw data. The following table displays an operation's average
    runtime in nanoseconds where the standard deviation is attached in braces:

<p>
    Similarly to static compilers, code generation libraries face a trade-off between generating fast code and generating
    code fast. When choosing between these conflicting goals, Byte Buddy's primary focus lies on generating code with
    minimal runtime. Typically, type creation or manipulation is not a common step within any program and does not significantly
    impact any long-running application; especially since class loading or class instrumentation is the most time-consuming
    and unavoidable step when running such code.
</p>

<p>
    The first benchmark in the above table measures a library's runtime for subclassing <code>Object</code> without
    implementing or overriding any methods. This gives us an impression of a library's general overhead in code generation.
    In this benchmark, Java proxies perform better than other libraries due to optimizations that are only possible when
    assuming to always extend an interface. Byte Buddy also checks classes for generic types and annotations what causes
    additional runtimes. This performance overhead is also visible in the other benchmarks for creating a class. Benchmark
    (2a) shows the measured runtime for creating (and loading) a class that implements a single interface with 18 methods,
    (2b) shows the execution time for the methods generated for this class. Similarly, (3a) shows a benchmark for extending a
    class with the same 18 methods which are implemented. Byte Buddy provides two benchmarks, due to a possible optimization
    that is possible for an interceptor that always executes the super method. Sacrificing some time during class creation,
    the execution time of a Byte Buddy-created classes typically reaches the baseline, meaning that the instrumentation creates
    no overhead at all. It should be noted that Byte Buddy outperforms any other code generation library also during class
    creation, if the meta data processing was disabled. As the runtime of code generation is however so minimal compared to
    a program's total runtime, such an opt-out is not available as it would gain very little performance to the sacrifice
    of complicating the library code.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, note that our metrics measure the performance of Java code that was priorly optimized by a
    JVM's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">just in time compiler</a>. If your code is
    only executed occasionally, the performance will be worse than it is suggested by the above metrics. In this
    case, your code is however not performance-critical to begin with. The code for this metrics is distributed
    together with Byte Buddy and you can run these metrics on your own computer where the above numbers might be scaled
    depending on your machine's processing power. For this reason, do not interpret the above numbers absolutely but
    consider them as a relative measure comparing different libraries. When further developing Byte Buddy, we want
    to monitor these metrics in order to avoid performance penalties when adding new features.
</p>

<p>
    In the following tutorial we will gradually explain the features of Byte Buddy. We will start with its more general
    features which are most likely used by a majority of users. We will then consider increasingly advanced topics and
    give a short introduction to Java byte code and the class file format. And don't be discouraged in case you fast
    forward to this later material! You can do almost anything by using Byte Buddy's standard API and without
    understanding any JVM specifics. For learning about the standard API, just read on.
</p>

</div>

<div class="row" id="gettingstarted">

<h2>Creating a class</h2>

<p>
    Any type that is created by Byte Buddy is emitted by an instance of the <code>ByteBuddy</code> class. Simply
    create a new instance by calling <code>new ByteBuddy()</code> and you are ready to go. Hopefully, you are using
    an development environment where you get suggestions on the methods that you can call on a given object. This
    way, you can avoid to manually look up a class's API in Byte Buddy's javadoc but have your IDE guide you through
    the process. As mentioned before, Byte Buddy offers a domain specific language which intends to be as
    human-readable as possible. Your IDE's hints will therefore point you into the right direction most of the time.
    But enough of the talking, let us create a first class at a Java program's runtime:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
DynamicType.Unloaded&lt;?&gt; dynamicType = new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Object.class)
  .make();
</pre>

<p>
    As it is hopefully obvious, the above code example creates a new class that extends the <code>Object</code>
    type.
    This dynamically created type would be equivalent to a Java class that only extends <code>Object</code> without
    explicitly implementing any methods, fields or constructors. You might have noted that we did not even name the
    dynamically generated type, something that normally is required when defining a Java class. Of course, you could
    have easily named your type explicitly:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
DynamicType.Unloaded&lt;?&gt; dynamicType = new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Object.class)
  .name("example.Type")
  .make();
</pre>

<p>
    But what happens without the explicit naming? Byte Buddy lives and breaths of
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration">convention over configuration</a> and
    provides you with defaults that we found convenient. As for the name of a type, the default Byte Buddy
    configuration provides a <code>NamingStrategy</code> which randomly creates a class name based on a dynamic
    type's superclass name. Furthermore, the name is defined to be in the same package as the super class such
    that package-private methods of the direct superclass are always visible to the dynamic type. If you for example
    subclassed a type named <code>example.Foo</code>, the generated name will be something like
    <code>example.Foo$$ByteBuddy$$1376491271</code> where the numeric sequence is random. An exception of this rule
    is made when subclassing types from the <code>java.lang</code> package where types such as <code>Object</code>
    live. Java's security model does not allow custom types to live in this namespace. Therefore, such type names
    are prefixed with <code>net.bytebuddy.renamed</code> by the default naming strategy.
</p>

<p>
    This default behavior might not be convenient for you. And thanks to the convention over configuration
    principle, you can always alter the default behavior by your needs. This is where the <code>ByteBuddy</code>
    class comes into place. By creating a <code>new ByteBuddy()</code> instance, you create a default configuration.
    By calling methods on this configuration, you can customize it by your individual needs. Let's try this:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">DynamicType.Unloaded&lt;?&gt; dynamicType = new ByteBuddy()
  .with(new NamingStrategy.AbstractBase() {
    @Override
    protected String name(TypeDescription superClass) {
        return "i.love.ByteBuddy." + superClass.getSimpleName();
    }
  })
  .subclass(Object.class)
  .make();
</pre>

<p>
    In the above code example, we created a new configuration that differs from the default configuration in its
    type naming strategy. The anonymous class is implemented to simply concatenate the string
    <code>i.love.ByteBuddy</code> and the base class's simple name. When subclassing the
    <code>Object</code> type, the dynamic type is therefore named <code>i.love.ByteBuddy.Object</code>. Be however
    careful when creating your own naming strategies! The Java virtual machine uses names to distinguish between types
    which is why you want to avoid naming collisions. If you need to customize the naming behavior, consider
    using Byte Buddy's built-in <code>NamingStrategy.SuffixingRandom</code> which you can customize to include
    a prefix that is more meaningful to your application than our default.
</p>

<h4>Domain specific language and immutability</h4>

<p>
    After seeing Byte Buddy's domain specific language in action, we need to have a short look at the way this
    language is implemented. The one detail you need to know about the implementation is that the language is built
    around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">immutable objects</a>. As a matter of fact,
    almost every class that lives in the Byte Buddy namespace was made immutable and in the few cases we could not
    make a type immutable, we explicitly mention it in this class's javadoc. If you implement custom
    features for Byte Buddy, we recommend you to stick with this principle.
</p>

<p>
    As an implication of the mentioned immutability, you must be careful when for example configuring
    <code>ByteBuddy</code> instances. You might for example make the following mistake:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
ByteBuddy byteBuddy = new ByteBuddy();
byteBuddy.withNamingStrategy(new NamingStrategy.SuffixingRandom("suffix"));
DynamicType.Unloaded&lt;?&gt; dynamicType = byteBuddy.subclass(Object.class).make();
</pre>

<p>
    You might expect the dynamic type to be generated using the custom naming strategy <code>new
    NamingStrategy.SuffixingRandom("suffix")</code> that was (allegedly) defined. Instead of mutating the
    instance that is stored in the <code>byteBuddy</code> variable, the invocation of the
    <code>withNamingStrategy</code> method returns a customized <code>ByteBuddy</code> instance which is however
    lost. As a result, the dynamic type is created using the default configuration which was originally created.
</p>

<h4>Redefining and rebasing existing classes</h4>

<p>
    So far, we only demonstrated how Byte Buddy can be used to create a subclass of an existing class. The same
    API can however be use for enhancing existing classes. Such enhancement is available in two different
    flavours:
</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal padded">
    <dt>
        type redefinition
    </dt>
    <dd>
        When redefining a class, Byte Buddy allows for the alteration of an existing class, either by adding fields
        and methods or by replacing existing method implementations. Preexisting method implementations are however
        lost if they are replaced by another implementation. For example, when redefining the following type<br/><br/>
<pre class="prettyprint">
class Foo {
  String bar() { return "bar"; }
}
</pre>
        to return <code>"qux"</code> from the <code>bar</code> method, the information that this method originally
        returned <code>"bar"</code> would be lost entirely.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        type rebasing
    </dt>
    <dd>
        When rebasing a class, Byte Buddy retains any method implementations of the rebased class. Instead of
        discarding overridden methods like when performing a <i>type redefinition</i>, Byte Buddy copies all such
        method implementations into renamed private methods with compatible signatures. This way, no implementation is
        lost and rebased methods can continue to invoke original code by calling these renamed methods. This way,
        the above class <code>Foo</code> could be rebased to something like<br/><br/>
<pre class="prettyprint">
class Foo {
  String bar() { return "foo" + bar$original(); }
  private String bar$original() { return "bar"; }
}
</pre>
        where the information that the <code>bar</code> method originally returned <code>"bar"</code> is preserved
        within another method and therefore remains accessible. When rebasing a class, Byte Buddy treats all method
        definitions such as if you defined a subclass, i.e. it will call the rebased method if you attempt to
        call a rebased method's super method implementation. But instead, it eventually flattens this hypothetical
        super class into the rebased type displayed above.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
    Any rebasing, redefinition or subclassing is performed using an identical API which is defined by the
    <code>DynamicType.Builder</code> interface. This way, it is possible to for example define a class as a subclass
    and to later alter the definition to represent a rebased class instead. This is achieved by merely changing a
    single word of Byte Buddy's domain specific language. This way, applying either of the possible approaches
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
new ByteBuddy().subclass(Foo.class)
new ByteBuddy().redefine(Foo.class)
new ByteBuddy().rebase(Foo.class)
</pre>

<p>
    is handled transparently during further stages of the definition process which is explained throughout the remainder
    of this tutorial. Because a subclass definition is a familiar concept to Java developers, all of the following
    explanations and examples of Byte Buddy's domain specific language are demonstrated by creating subclasses.
    However, keep in mind that all classes could similarly be defined by redefinition or by rebasing.
</p>

<h4>Loading a class</h4>

<p>
    So far we only have defined and created a dynamic type but we did not make any use of it. A type that is
    created by Byte Buddy is represented by an instance of <code>DynamicType.Unloaded</code>. As the name
    suggests, these types are not loaded into the Java virtual machine. Instead, classes created by Byte Buddy are
    represented in their binary form, in the
    <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html">Java class file format</a>. This way,
    it is up to you to decide what you want to do with a generated type. For example, you might want to run
    Byte Buddy from a build script that only generates classes to enhance a Java application before it is deployed.
    For this purpose, the <code>DynamicType.Unloaded</code> class allows to extract a byte array that represents
    the dynamic type. For convenience, the type additionally offers a <code>saveIn(File)</code> method that allows
    you to store a class in a given folder. Furthermore, it allows you to <code>inject(File)</code> classes into
    an existing <i>jar</i> file.
</p>

<p>
    While directly accessing a class's binary form is straight forward, loading a type is unfortunately more
    complex. In Java, all classes are loaded using a <code>ClassLoader</code>. One example for such a class loader
    is the bootstrap class loader which is responsible for loading the classes that are shipped within the Java class
    library. The system class loader, on the other hand, is responsible for loading classes on the Java application's
    class path. Obviously, none of these preexisting class loaders is aware of any dynamic class we have created.
    To overcome this, we have to find other possibilities for loading a runtime generated class. Byte Buddy offers
    solutions by different approaches out of the box:
</p>

<ul class="colored-list padded">
    <li><span>
        We simply create a new <code>ClassLoader</code> which is explicitly told about the existence of a
        particular dynamically created class. Because Java class loaders are organized in hierarchies, we define this
        class loader as the child of a given class loader that already exists in the running Java application. This way,
        all types of the running Java program are visible to the dynamic type that was loaded with new
        <code>ClassLoader</code>.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        Normally, Java class loaders query their parent <code>ClassLoader</code> before attempting to directly load a
        type of a given name. This implies that a class loader normally never loads a type in case that its parent
        class loader is aware of a type with identical name. For this purpose, Byte Buddy offers the creation of a
        child-first class loader which attempts to load a type by itself before querying its parent. Other than that,
        this approach is similar to the approach just mentioned above. Note that this approach does not override a type
        of a parent class loader but rather shadows this other type.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        Finally, we can use reflection to inject a type into an existent <code>ClassLoader</code>. Usually, a class
        loader is asked to provide a given type by its name. Using reflection, we can turn this principle around and
        call a protected method to inject a new class into the class loader without the class loader actually knowing
        how to locate this dynamic class.
     </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Unfortunately, the above approaches have both their downsides:
</p>

<ul class="colored-list padded">
    <li><span>
        If we create a new <code>ClassLoader</code>, this class loader defines a new namespace. As an implication,
        it is possible to load two classes with identical name as long as these classes are loaded by two different
        class loaders. These two classes are then never be considered as equal by a Java virtual machine, even if
        both classes represent an identical class implementation. This rule for equality holds however also for Java
        packages. This means that a class <code>example.Foo</code> is not able to access package-private
        methods of another class <code>example.Bar</code> if both classes were not loaded with the same class loader.
        Also, if <code>example.Bar</code> extended <code>example.Foo</code>, any overridden package-private methods
        would become inoperative but would delegate to the original implementations.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        Whenever a class is loaded, its class loader will look up any type that is referenced in this class
        once a code segment referencing another type is is resolved. This lookup delegates to the same class loader.
        Imagine a scenario where we dynamically created two classes <code>example.Foo</code> and <code>example.Bar</code>.
        If we injected <code>example.Foo</code> into an existent class loader, this class loader might attempt to
        locate <code>example.Bar</code>. This lookup would however fail since the latter class was created dynamically
        and is unreachable for the class loader into which we just injected the <code>example.Foo</code> class.
        Therefore, the reflective approach cannot be used for classes with circular dependencies that become
        effective during class loading. Fortunately, most JVM implementations resolve referenced classes lazily on
        their first active use which is why class injection normally works without these restrictions. Also, in
        practice, classes that are created by Byte Buddy normally do not suffer from such circularity.
    </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
    You might consider the chance of encountering circular dependencies to be of minor relevance since you
    are creating one dynamic type at a time. However, the dynamic creation of a type might trigger the creation of
    so-called auxiliary types. These types are created by Byte Buddy automatically to provide access to the dynamic
    type you are creating. We learn more about auxiliary types in the following section, do not worry about
    them for now. However, because of this, we recommend you to load dynamically created classes by creating a
    specific <code>ClassLoader</code> instead of injecting them into an existing one, whenever possible.
</p>

<p>
    After creating a <code>DynamicType.Unloaded</code>, this type can be loaded using a
    <code>ClassLoadingStrategy</code>. If no such strategy is provided, Byte Buddy infers such a strategy based on
    the provided class loader and creates a new class loader only for the bootstrap class loader where no type can
    be injected using reflection which is otherwise the default. Byte Buddy provides several class loadings strategies
    out of the box where each follows one of the concepts that were described above. These strategies are defined in
    <code>ClassLoadingStrategy.Default</code> where the <code>WRAPPER</code> strategy creates a new, wrapping
    <code>ClassLoader</code>, where the <code>CHILD_FIRST</code> strategy creates a similar class loader with
    child-first semantics and where the <code>INJECTION</code> strategy injects a dynamic type using reflection.
    Both the <code>WRAPPER</code> and the <code>CHILD_FIRST</code> strategies are also available in so-called
    <i>manifest</i> versions where a type's binary format is preserved even after a class was loaded. These alternative
    versions make the binary representation of a class loader's classes accessible via the
    <code>ClassLoader::getResourceAsStream</code> method. However, note that this requires these class loaders to
    maintain a reference to the full binary representation of a class what consumes space on a JVM's heap. Therefore,
    you should only use the manifest versions if you plan to actually access the binary format. Since the
    <code>INJECTION</code> strategy works via reflection and without a possibility to change the semantics of the
    <code>ClassLoader::getResourceAsStream</code> method, it is naturally not available in a manifest version.
</p>

<p>
    Let's look at such class loading in action:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
Class&lt;?&gt; type = new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Object.class)
  .make()
  .load(getClass().getClassLoader(), ClassLoadingStrategy.Default.WRAPPER)
  .getLoaded();
</pre>

<p>
    In the above example, we have created and loaded a class. We used the <code>WRAPPER</code> strategy for loading
    the class which is suitable for most cases, as we mentioned it before. Finally, the <code>getLoaded</code> method
    returns an instance of a Java <code>Class</code> that represents the dynamic class which is now loaded.
</p>

<p>
    Note that when loading classes, the predefined class loading strategies are executed by applying the
    <code>ProtectionDomain</code> of the current execution context. Alternatively, all default strategies offer
    the specification of an explicit protection domain by calling the <code>withProtectionDomain</code> method.
    Defining an explicit protection domain is important when using security managers or when working with classes
    that are defined in signed jars.
</p>

<h4>Reloading a class</h4>

<p>
    In a previous section, we learned how Byte Buddy can be used in order to redefine or to rebase an existing class.
    During the execution of a Java program, it is however often impossible to guarantee that a specific class is not
    already loaded. (Furthermore, Byte Buddy currently only takes loaded classes as its argument, this will change
    in future versions where the existing API can be used to equally work with unloaded classes.) Thanks to the
    Java virtual machine's HotSwap feature, existing classes can however be redefined even after they are loaded.
    This feature is made accessible by Byte Buddy's <code>ClassReloadingStrategy</code>. Let us demonstrate this
    strategy by redefining a class <code>Foo</code>:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class Foo {
  String m() { return "foo"; }
}

class Bar {
  String m() { return "bar"; }
}
</pre>

<p>
    Using Byte Buddy, we can now easily redefine the class <code>Foo</code> to become <code>Bar</code>. Using
    HotSwap, this redefinition will even apply for preexisting instances:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
ByteBuddyAgent.install();
Foo foo = new Foo();
new ByteBuddy()
  .redefine(Bar.class)
  .name(Foo.class.getName())
  .make()
  .load(Foo.class.getClassLoader(), ClassReloadingStrategy.fromInstalledAgent());
assertThat(foo.m(), is("bar"));
</pre>

<p>
    HotSwap is only accessible using a
    <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html">so-called Java
        agent</a>.
    Such an agent can be installed by either specifying it on the startup of the Java virtual machine by using the
    <code>-javaagent</code> parameter where the parameter's argument needs to be Byte Buddy's agent jar which can be
    <a href="https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:byte-buddy-agent">downloaded from Maven Central</a>. However,
    when a Java application is run from a JDK-installation of the Java virtual machine, Byte Buddy can load a Java
    agent even after application startup by <code>ByteBuddyAgent.installOnOpenJDK()</code>. Because class redefinition
    is mostly used to implement tooling or testing, this can be a very convenient alternative.
    Since Java 9, an agent installation is also possible at runtime without a JDK-installation.
</p>

<p>
    One thing that might first appear counter-intuitive about the above example is the fact that Byte Buddy is
    instructed to redefine the <code>Bar</code> type where the <code>Foo</code> type is eventually redefined. The
    Java virtual machine identifies types by their name and a class loader. Therefore, by renaming <code>Bar</code>
    to <code>Foo</code> and applying this definition, we eventually redefine the type we renamed <code>Bar</code>
    into. It is of course equally possible to redefine <code>Foo</code> directly without renaming a different type.
</p>

<p>
    Using Java's HotSwap feature, there is however one huge drawback. Current implementations of HotSwap require that
    the redefined classes apply the same class schema both before and after a class redefinition. This means that it
    is not allowed to add methods or fields when reloading classes. We already discussed that Byte Buddy defines
    copies of the original methods for any rebased class such that class rebasing does not work for the
    <code>ClassReloadingStrategy</code>. Also, class redefinition does not work for classes with an explicit class
    initializer method (a static block within a class) because this initializer needs to be copied into an extra method
    as well. Unfortunately OpenJDK has withdrawn from <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/159">extending HotSwap
    functionality</a>, so there is no way to work around this limitation using the HotSwap feature. In the mean time,
    Byte Buddy's HotSwap support can be used for corner-cases where it seems useful. Otherwise, class rebasing and
    redefinition can be a convenient feature when enhancing existing classes from for example a build script.
</p>

<h4>Working with unloaded classes</h4>

<p>
    With this realization about the limits of Java's HotSwap feature, one might think that the only meaningful
    application of the <code>rebase</code> and <code>redefinition</code> instructions would be during build time.
    By applying build-time manipulation, one can assert that a processed class is not loaded before its initial
    class loading simply because this class loading is accomplished in a different instance of the JVM. Byte Buddy
    is however equally capable of working with classes that were not yet loaded. For this, Byte Buddy abstracts over
    Java's reflection API such that a <code>Class</code> instance is for example internally represented by an
    instance of a <code>TypeDescription</code>. As a matter of fact, Byte Buddy only knows how to process a provided
    <code>Class</code> by an adapter that implements the <code>TypeDescription</code> interface. The big
    advantage over this abstraction is that information on classes do not need to be provided by a
    <code>ClassLoader</code> but can be provided by any other sources.
</p>

<p>
    Byte Buddy provides a canonical manner for getting hold of a class's <code>TypeDescription</code> using a
    <code>TypePool</code>. A default implementation of such a pool is of course also provided. This
    <code>TypePool.Default</code> implementation parses the binary format of a class and represents it as the
    required <code>TypeDescription</code>. Similarly to a <code>ClassLoader</code> it maintains a cache for
    represented classes which is also customizable. Also, it normally retrieves the binary format of a class from
    a <code>ClassLoader</code>, however without instructing it to load this class.
</p>

<p>
    The Java virtual machine only loads a class on its first usage. As a consequence, we can for example safely
    redefine a class such as
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
package foo;
class Bar { }
</pre>

<p>
    right at program startup before running any other code:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class MyApplication {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    TypePool typePool = TypePool.Default.ofSystemLoader();
    Class<?> bar = new ByteBuddy()
      .redefine(typePool.describe("foo.Bar").resolve(), // do not use 'Bar.class'
                ClassFileLocator.ForClassLoader.ofSystemLoader())
      .defineField("qux", String.class) // we learn more about defining fields later
      .make()
      .load(ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader(), ClassLoadingStrategy.Default.INJECTION)
      .getLoaded();
    assertThat(bar.getDeclaredField("qux"), notNullValue());
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    By explicitly loading the redefined class before its first use in the assertion statement, we forestall the JVM's
    built-in class loading. This way, the redefined definition of <code>foo.Bar</code> is loaded and used throughout
    our application's runtime. Note however that we do not reference the class by a class literal when we use the
    <code>TypePool</code> to provide a description. If we did use a class literal for <code>foo.Bar</code>, the JVM
    would have loaded this class before we had a chance to redefine it and our redefinition attempt would be without
    effect. Also, note that when working with unloaded classes, we further need to specify a
    <code>ClassFileLocator</code> which allows to locate a class's class file. In the example above, we simply
    create a class file locator which scans the running application's class path for such files.
</p>

<h4>Creating Java agents</h4>

<p>
    When an application grows bigger and becomes more modular, applying such a transformation at a specific program
    point is of course a cumbersome constraint to enforce. And there is indeed a better way to apply such class
    redefinitions <i>on demand</i>. Using a
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html">Java agent</a>,
    it is possible to directly intercept any class loading activity that is conducted within a Java application. A
    Java agent is implemented as a simple <i>jar</i> file with an entry point that is specified in this jar file's
    manifest file as it is described under the linked resource. Using Byte Buddy, the implementation of such an
    agent is straight forward by using an <code>AgentBuilder</code>. Assuming that we previously defined a simple
    annotation named <code>ToString</code>, it would be trivial to implement <code>toString</code> methods
    for all annotated classes simply by implementing the Agent's <code>premain</code> method as follows:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class ToStringAgent {
  public static void premain(String arguments, Instrumentation instrumentation) {
    new AgentBuilder.Default()
        .type(isAnnotatedWith(ToString.class))
        .transform(new AgentBuilder.Transformer() {
      @Override
      public DynamicType.Builder<?> transform(DynamicType.Builder<?> builder,
                                              TypeDescription typeDescription,
                                              ClassLoader classloader) {
        return builder.method(named("toString"))
                      .intercept(FixedValue.value("transformed"));
      }
    }).installOn(instrumentation);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    As a result of the applying the above <code>AgentBuilder.Transformer</code>, all <code>toString</code> methods
    of the annotated classes would now return <code>transformed</code>. We will learn all about Byte Buddy's
    <code>DynamicType.Builder</code> in the upcoming sections, do not worry about this class for now. The above
    code results of course in a trivial and meaningless application. Using this concept right, renders however a
    powerful tool for easily implementing aspect-oriented programing.
</p>

<p>
    Note that it is also possible to instrument classes that were loaded by the bootstrap class loader when using an
    agent. However, this requires some preparation. First of all, the bootstrap class loader is represented by the
    <code>null</code> value which makes it impossible to load a class in this class loader using reflection. This
    is however sometimes necessary to load helper classes into the instrumented class's class loader to support the
    class's implementation. In order to load classes into the bootstrap class loader, Byte Buddy can create jar files
    and add these files to the bootstrap class loader's load path. To make this possible, it is however required to
    save these classes to disk. A folder for these classes can be specified using the
    <code>enableBootstrapInjection</code> command which also takes an instance of the <code>Instrumentation</code>
    interface in order to append the classes. Note that all user classes that are used by the instrumented class are
    also required to be put on the bootstrap search path which is possible using the <code>Instrumentation</code>
    interface.
</p>

<h4>Loading classes in Android applications</h4>

<p>
    Android uses a different class file format using <i>dex</i> files which are not in the layout of the Java class
    file format. Furthermore, with the <i>ART</i> runtime which succeeds the Dalvik virtual machine, Android
    applications are compiled into native machine code before being installed on an Android device. As a result,
    Byte Buddy cannot longer redefine or rebase classes as long as an applications is not explicitly deployed
    together with its Java sources as there is otherwise no intermediate code representation to interpret. Byte
    Buddy is however still capable to define new classes using a <code>DexClassLoader</code> together with a built-in
    <i>dex compiler</i>. For this purpose, Byte Buddy offers the <code>byte-buddy-android</code> module which contains
    the <code>AndroidClassLoadingStrategy</code> which allows the loading of dynamically created classes from within
    an Android application. In order to function, it requires a folder for writing temporary files and compiled
    class files. This folder must not be shared among different applications as this is forbidden by Android's
    security manager.
</p>

<h4>Working with generic types</h4>

<p>
    Byte Buddy is processing generic types as they are defined by the Java programming language. Generic types are
    not considered by the Java runtime which only processes the erasures of generic types. However, generic types
    are still embedded into any Java class file and are exposed by the Java reflection API. Therefore, it sometime
    makes sense to include generic information into a generated class because the generic type information can effect
    the behavior of other libraries and frameworks. Embedding generic type information is also important when a class
    is persisted and processed as a library by the Java compiler.
</p>

<p>
    When subclassing a class, implementing an interface or when declaring a field or method, Byte Buddy accepts
    a Java <code>Type</code> instead of an erased <code>Class</code> for the above reasons. Generic types can
    also be defined explicitly by using the <code>TypeDescription.Generic.Builder</code>. One important difference
    of Java generic types to type erasures is the contextual meaning of type variables. A type variable of a
    certain name that is defined by some type does not necessarily denote the same type when another type declares
    the same type variable by the same name. Therefore, Byte Buddy rebinds all generic types that denote type
    variables in the context of the generated type or method when a <code>Type</code> instance is handed to the
    library.
</p>

<p>
    Byte Buddy also inserts
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/bridgeMethods.html"><i>bridge methods</i></a>
    transparently when a type is created. Bridge methods are resolved by a <code>MethodGraph.Compiler</code>
    which is a property of any <code>ByteBuddy</code> instance. The default method graph compiler behaves like
    the Java compiler and processes any class file's generic type information. For other languages than Java,
    a differen method graph compiler might however be appropriate.
</p>

<div class="row" id="members">

<h2>Fields and methods</h2>

<p>
    Most types we created in the previous section did not define any fields or methods. However, by subclassing
    <code>Object</code>, the created class inherits the methods that are defined by its super class. Let us verify this
    Java trivia and call the <code>toString</code> method on an instance of the dynamic type. We can get hold of an
    instance by calling the created class's constructor reflectively.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
String toString = new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Object.class)
  .name("example.Type")
  .make()
  .load(getClass().getClassLoader())
  .getLoaded()
  .newInstance() // Java reflection API
  .toString();
</pre>

<p>
    The implementation of the <code>Object#toString</code> method returns the concatenation of the instance's fully
    qualified class name and the hex representation of the instance's hash code. And in fact, invoking the
    <code>toString</code> method on the created instance returns something like <code>example.Type@340d1fa5</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, we are not done here. The main motivation of creating dynamic classes is the ability to define new
    logic. To demonstrate how this is done, let us start with something simple. We want to override the
    <code>toString</code> method and return <code>Hello World!</code> instead of the previous default value:

<pre class="prettyprint">
String toString = new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Object.class)
  .name("example.Type")
  .method(named("toString")).intercept(FixedValue.value("Hello World!"))
  .make()
  .load(getClass().getClassLoader())
  .getLoaded()
  .newInstance()
  .toString();
</pre>

<p>
    The line we added to our code contains two instructions in Byte Buddy's domain specific language. The first
    instruction is <code>method</code> which allows us to select any number of methods that we want to override.
    This selection is applied by handing over a <code>ElementMatcher</code> which serves as a predicate to decide
    for each overridable method if it should be overridden or not. Byte Buddy comes with a lot of predefined method
    matchers which are collected in the <code>ElementMatchers</code> class. Normally, you would import this class
    statically such that the resulting code reads more naturally. Such a static import was also assumed for the
    above example where we used the <code>named</code> method matcher which selects methods by their exact names.
    Note that the predefined method matchers are composable. This way, we could have described the method selection
    in further detail such as by:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
named("toString").and(returns(String.class)).and(takesArguments(0))
</pre>

<p>
    This latter method matcher describes the <code>toString</code> method by its full Java signature and therefore
    only matches this particular method. However, in the given context we know that there is no other method
    named <code>toString</code> with a different signature such that our original method matcher is sufficient.
</p>

<p>
    After selecting the <code>toString</code> method, the second instruction <code>intercept</code> determines
    the implementation that should override all methods of the given selection. In order to know how to implement a
    method, this instruction requires a single argument of type <code>Implementation</code>. In the above example,
    we are making use of the <code>FixedValue</code> implementation which ships with Byte Buddy. As suggested by
    this class's name, the implementation implements a method to always return a given value. We will have a more
    detailed look at the <code>FixedValue</code> implementation a little later in this section. Right now, let us
    rather look a little closer at the method selection.
</p>

<p>
    So far, we only intercepted a single method. In real applications, things might however be more complicated and
    we might want to apply different rules for overriding different methods. Let us look at an example of such a
    scenario:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class Foo {
  public String bar() { return null; }
  public String foo() { return null; }
  public String foo(Object o) { return null; }
}

Foo dynamicFoo = new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Foo.class)
  .method(isDeclaredBy(Foo.class)).intercept(FixedValue.value("One!"))
  .method(named("foo")).intercept(FixedValue.value("Two!"))
  .method(named("foo").and(takesArguments(1))).intercept(FixedValue.value("Three!"))
  .make()
  .load(getClass().getClassLoader())
  .getLoaded()
  .newInstance();
</pre>

<p>
    In the above example, we defined three different rules for overriding methods. When investigating the code, you
    will notice that the first rule concerns any method that is defined by <code>Foo</code>, i.e. all three
    methods in the example class. The second rule matches both methods that are named <code>foo</code>, a subset of
    the previous selection. And the last rule only matches the <code>foo(Object)</code> method which is a
    further reduction of the former selection. But given this selection overlap, how does Byte Buddy decide which rule
    is applied to which method?
</p>

<p>
    Byte Buddy organizes rules for overriding methods in a stack form. This means that whenever you register a new
    rule for overriding a method, ít is pushed on the top of this stack and is always applied first until a new rule
    is added which will then be of even higher priority. For the above example, this means that:
</p>

<ul class="colored-list padded">
    <li><span>
        The <code>bar()</code> method is first matched against <code>named("foo").and(takesArguments(1))</code>
        and then against <code>named("foo")</code> where both matching attempts turn out negative. Finally, the
        <code>isDeclaredBy(Foo.class)</code> matcher gives green light to override the <code>bar()</code> method to
        return <code>One!</code>.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        Similarly, the <code>foo()</code> method is first matched against
        <code>named("foo").and(takesArguments(1))</code> first where the missing argument results in an unsuccessful
        matching. After this, the <code>named("foo")</code> matcher determines a positive match such that the
        <code>foo()</code> method is overridden to return <code>Two!</code>.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        The <code>foo(Object)</code> is immediately matched by the <code>named("foo").and(takesArguments(1))</code>
        matcher such that the overridden implementation returns <code>Three!</code>.
    </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Because of this organization, you should always register more specific method matchers last. Otherwise, any less
    specific method matcher that is registered afterwards might prevent rules that you defined before from being
    applied. Note that the <code>ByteBuddy</code> configuration allows to define an <code>ignoreMethod</code>
    property. Methods that are successfully matched against this method matcher are never overridden. By default,
    Byte Buddy does not override any synthetic methods.
</p>

<p>
    In some scenarios, you might want to define a new method that does not override a method of a super type or an
    interface. This is also possible using Byte Buddy. For this purpose, you can call <code>defineMethod</code> where
    you are able to define a signature. After defining a method, you are ask to provide an
    <code>Implementation</code> just as with a method that was identified by a method matcher. Note that method
    matchers that are registered after a method's definition might supersede this implementation by the stacking
    principle that we discussed before.
</p>

<p>
    With <code>defineField</code>, Byte Buddy allows to define fields for a given type. In Java, fields are never
    overridden but can only be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing">shadowed</a>. For this reason,
    no field matching or the like is available.
</p>

<p>
    With this knowledge on how methods are selected, we are ready to learn about how we can implement these methods.
    For this purpose, we now look at predefined <code>Implementation</code> implementations that ship with Byte Buddy.
    Defining custom implementation is discussed in the its own section and is only intended for users that require
    very custom method implementations.
</p>

<h4>A closer look at fixed values</h4>

<p>
    We have already seen the <code>FixedValue</code> implementation in action. As the name suggests, methods
    that are implemented by <code>FixedValue</code> simply return a provided object. A class is able to remember
    such an object in two different manners:
</p>

<ul class="colored-list padded">
    <li><span>
        The fixed value is written to a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_class_file#The_constant_pool">class's constant pool</a>. The
        constant pool is a section within the Java class file format and contains numerous stateless values that
        describe the properties of any class. The constant pool is mainly required to remember a class's properties
        such as the class's name or the names of its methods. Besides these reflective properties, the constant
        pool has room for storing any string or primitive value that is used within a method or a field of the
        class. Besides strings and primitive values, the class pool can also store references to other types.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        The value is stored in a static field of the class. For this to happen, the field must however be assigned
        the given value once the class was loaded into the Java virtual machine. For this purpose, every
        dynamically created class is accompanied by a <code>TypeInitializer</code> which can be configured to
        execute such explicit initialization. When you instruct a <code>DynamicType.Unloaded</code> to be loaded,
        Byte Buddy automatically triggers its type initializer such that the class is ready for use. Therefore,
        you do not normally need to worry about type initializers. However, if you want to load dynamic classes to
        be loaded outside of Byte Buddy, it is important that you run their type initializers manually after these
        classes are loaded. Otherwise, a <code>FixedValue</code> implementation would for example return
        <code>null</code> instead of the required value because the static field was never assigned this value.
        Many dynamic types might however not require explicit initialization. A class's type initializer can
        therefore be queried for its liveliness by calling its <code>isAlive</code> method. If you need to trigger
        a <code>TypeInitializer</code> manually, you find it exposed by the <code>DynamicType</code> interface.
    </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
    When you implement a method by <code>FixedValue#value(Object)</code>, Byte Buddy analyzes the parameter's
    type and define it to be stored in the class pool of the dynamic type if possible and otherwise store the value
    in a static field. Note however that the instance that is returned by the selected methods might be of a
    different object identity if the value was stored in the class pool. Therefore, you can instruct Byte Buddy to
    always store an object in a static field by using <code>FixedValue#reference(Object)</code>. The latter method
    is overloaded such that you can provide the field's name as a second argument. Otherwise, a field name is derived
    automatically from the object's hash code. An exception from this behavior is the <code>null</code> value.
    The <code>null</code> value is never stored in a field but is simply represented by its literal expression.
</p>

<p>
    You might wonder about type safety in this context. Obviously, you could define a method to return an invalid
    value:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Foo.class)
  .method(isDeclaredBy(Foo.class)).intercept(FixedValue.value(0))
  .make();
</pre>

<p>
    It would be difficult to prevent this invalid implementation by the compiler within Java's type system. Instead,
    Byte Buddy will throw an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> when the type is created and the illegal assignment
    of an integer to a method that returns a <code>String</code> becomes effective. Byte Buddy tries its best to assure
    that all its created types are legal Java types and <i>fail fast</i> by throwing an exception during the creation
    of an illegal type.
</p>

<p>
    Byte Buddy's assignment behavior is customizable. Again, Byte Buddy only provides a sane default which mimics
    the assignment behavior of the Java compiler. Consequently, Byte Buddy allows an assignment of a type to any
    of its super types and it will also consider to box primitive values or to unbox their wrapper representations.
    Note however, that Byte Buddy does currently not fully support generic types and will only consider type erasures.
    Therefore, it is possible that Byte Buddy causes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_pollution">heap
    pollution</a>. Instead of using the predefined assigner, you can always implement your own <code>Assigner</code>
    which is capable of type transformations that are not implicit in the Java programming language. We will look
    into such custom implementations in the last section of this tutorial. For now, we settle for mentioning that
    you can define such custom assigners by calling <code>withAssigner</code> on any <code>FixedValue</code>
    implementation.
</p>

<h4>Delegating a method call</h4>

<p>
    In many scenarios, returning a fixed value from a method is of course insufficient. For more flexibility, Byte
    Buddy provides the <code>MethodDelegation</code> implementation which offers maximal freedom in reacting to method
    calls. A method delegation defines a method of the dynamically created type to forward any call to another
    method which may live outside of the dynamic type. This way, a dynamic class's logic can be represented using
    plain Java while only the binding to another method is achieved by code generation. Before discussing the details,
    let us look at an example of using a <code>MethodDelegation</code>:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class Source {
  public String hello(String name) { return null; }
}

class Target {
  public static String hello(String name) {
    return "Hello " + name + "!";
  }
}

String helloWorld = new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Source.class)
  .method(named("hello")).intercept(MethodDelegation.to(Target.class))
  .make()
  .load(getClass().getClassLoader())
  .getLoaded()
  .newInstance()
  .hello("World");
</pre>

<p>
    In the example, we are delegating invocations of the <code>Source#hello(String)</code> method to the
    <code>Target</code> type such that the method returns <code>Hello World!</code> instead of <code>null</code>.
    For this purpose, the <code>MethodDelegation</code> implementation identifies any invokable method of the
    <code>Target</code> type and identifies a <i>best match</i> among those methods. In the above example, this is
    trivial since the <code>Target</code> type only defines a single static method where the method's parameters,
    return type and name are conveniently identical to those of <code>Source#name(String)</code>.
</p>

<p>
    In reality, the decision for a delegation target method will most likely be more complex. So how does Byte Buddy
    decide between methods if there is an actual choice? For this purpose, let us assume the <code>Target</code> class
    to be defined as follows:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class Target {
  public static String intercept(String name) { return "Hello " + name + "!"; }
  public static String intercept(int i) { return Integer.toString(i); }
  public static String intercept(Object o) { return o.toString(); }
}
</pre>

<p>
    You might have noticed that the above methods are now all called <code>intercept</code>. Byte Buddy does not require
    target methods to be named equally to a source method. We will look closer into this matter shortly. More
    importantly, if you ran the former example with the altered definition of <code>Target</code>, you would
    observe that the the <code>named(String)</code> method was bound to <code>intercept(String)</code>. But why
    is that? Obviously, the <code>intercept(int)</code> method cannot receive the <code>String</code> argument of the
    source method and is therefore not even considered as a possible match. However, this is not true for the
    <code>intercept(Object)</code> method which could be bound. In order to resolve this ambiguity, Byte Buddy once
    again mimics the Java compiler by choosing the method binding with the most specific parameter types. Remember how
    the Java compiler chooses a binding for an overloaded method! Since <code>String</code> is more specific than
    <code>Object</code>, the <code>intercept(String)</code> class is finally chosen among the three alternatives.
</p>

<p>
    With the information so far, you might consider the method binding algorithm to be of a rather rigid nature.
    However, we have not yet told the full story. So far we only observed another example of the convention over
    configuration principle which is open for change if the defaults do not fit the actual requirements. In reality,
    the <code>MethodDelegation</code> implementation works with annotations where a parameter's annotation decides
    what value should be assigned to it. However, if no annotation is found, Byte Buddy treats a parameter as if
    it was annotated with <code>@Argument</code>. This latter annotation causes Byte Buddy to assign the <code>n</code>-th
    argument of the source method to the annotated target. When the annotation is not added explicitly, the value
    of <code>n</code> is set to the annotated parameter's index. According to this rule, Byte Buddy treats
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
void foo(Object o1, Object o2)
</pre>

<p>
    as if the all parameters were annotated as:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
void foo(@Argument(0) Object o1, @Argument(1) Object o2)
</pre>

<p>
    As a result, the first and the second argument of the instrumented method are assigned to the interceptor. If the
    intercepted method does not declare at least two parameters or if the annotated parameter types are not assignable
    from the instrumented method's parameter types, the interceptor method in question is discarded.
</p>

<p>
    Besides the <code>@Argument</code> annotation, there are several other pre-defined annotations that can be used
    with a <code>MethodDelegation</code>:
</p>

<ul class="colored-list padded">
    <li><span>
        Parameters that carry the <code>@AllArguments</code> annotation must be of an array type and are assigned
        an array containing all of the source method's arguments. For this purpose, all source method parameters must
        be assignable to the array's component type. If this is not the case, the current target method is not
        considered as a candidate for being bound to the source method.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        The <code>@This</code> annotation induces the assignment of the dynamic type's instance on which the
        intercepted method is currently invoked. If the annotated parameter is not assignable to an instance of
        the dynamic type, the current method is not considered as a candidate for being bound to the source method.
        Note that calling any methods on this instance will result in calling a potentially instrumented method
        implementation. For calling overridden implementations, you need to use the <code>@Super</code> annotation
        which is discussed below. A typical reason for using the <code>@This</code> annotation to gain access to an
        instance's fields.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        Parameters that are annotated with <code>@Origin</code> must be of used on any of the types <code>Method</code>,
        <code>Constructor</code>, <code>Executable</code>, <code>Class</code>, <code>MethodHandle</code>,
        <code>MethodType</code>, <code>String</code> or <code>int</code>. Depending on the parameter's type, it is
        assigned a <code>Method</code> or <code>Constructor</code> reference to the original method or constuctor that
        is now instrumented or a reference to the dynamically created <code>Class</code>. When using Java 8, it is also
        possible to receive either a method or constructor reference by using the <code>Executable</code> type in the
        interceptor. If the annotated parameter is a <code>String</code>, the parameter is assigned the value that the
        <code>Method</code>'s <code>toString</code> method would have returned. In general, we recommend the use of
        these <code>String</code> values as method identifiers wherever possible and discourage the use of
        <code>Method</code> objects as their lookup introduces a significant runtime overhead. To avoid this overhead,
        the <code>@Origin</code> annotation also offers a property for caching such instances for reuse. Note that
        the <code>MethodHandle</code> and <code>MethodType</code> are stored in a class's constant pool such that
        classes using these constants must at least be of Java version 7. Instead of using reflection for reflectively
        invoking an intercepted method on another object, we furthermore recommend the use of the <code>@Pipe</code>
        annotation which is discussed later in this section. When using the <code>@Origin</code> annotation on a
        parameter of type <code>int</code>, it is assigned the modifier of the instrumented method.
    </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Besides using the predefined annotations, Byte Buddy allows you to define your own annotations by registering
    one or several <code>ParameterBinder</code>s. We will look into such customization in the last section of this
    tutorial.
</p>

<p>
    Besides the four annotation we have discussed so far, there exist two other predefined annotations that grant
    access to the super implementations of a dynamic type's methods. This way, a dynamic type could for example add
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">aspects</a> to a class such as the logging
    of method invocations. Using the <code>@SuperCall</code> annotation, an invocation of the super implementation of
    a method can be executed even from outside the dynamic class as demonstrated in the following example:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class MemoryDatabase {
  public List&lt;String&gt; load(String info) {
    return Arrays.asList(info + ": foo", info + ": bar");
  }
}

class LoggerInterceptor {
  public static List&lt;String&gt; log(@SuperCall Callable&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; zuper)
      throws Exception {
    System.out.println("Calling database");
    try {
      return zuper.call();
    } finally {
      System.out.println("Returned from database");
    }
  }
}

MemoryDatabase loggingDatabase = new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(MemoryDatabase.class)
  .method(named("load")).intercept(MethodDelegation.to(LoggerInterceptor.class))
  .make()
  .load(getClass().getClassLoader())
  .getLoaded()
  .newInstance();
</pre>

<p>
    From the above example, it is obvious that the super method is called by injecting some instance of a
    <code>Callable</code> into the <code>LoggerInterceptor</code> which invokes the original, non-overridden
    implementation of <code>MemoryDatabase#load(String)</code> from its <code>call</code> method. This helper
    class is called an <code>AuxiliaryType</code> within Byte Buddy's terminology. Auxiliary types are created
    on demand by Byte Buddy and are directly accessible from the <code>DynamicType</code> interface after a
    class was created. Because of such auxiliary types, the manual creation of one dynamic type might
    result in the creation of several additional types which aid the implementation of the original class. Finally,
    note that the <code>@SuperCall</code> annotation can also be used on the <code>Runnable</code> type where
    the original method's return value is however dropped.
</p>

<p>
    You might still wonder how this auxiliary type is able to call a super method of another type what is normally
    forbidden in Java. On closer inspection, this behavior is however quite common and resembles the compiled code
    that is generated when the following Java source code snippet gets compiled:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class LoggingMemoryDatabase extends MemoryDatabase {

  private class LoadMethodSuperCall implements Callable {

    private final String info;
    private LoadMethodSuperCall(String info) {
      this.info = info;
    }

    @Override
    public Object call() throws Exception {
      return LoggingMemoryDatabase.super.load(info);
    }
  }

  @Override
  public List&lt;String&gt; load(String info) {
    return LoggerInterceptor.log(new LoadMethodSuperCall(info));
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    Sometimes, you might however want to call a super method with different arguments than those that were assigned on
    the method's original invocation. This is also possible in Byte Buddy by using the <code>@Super</code> annotation.
    This annotation triggers the creation of another <code>AuxiliaryType</code> which now extends a super class or
    an interface of the dynamic type in question. Similar to before, the auxiliary type overrides all methods to
    call their super implementations on the dynamic type. This way, the example logger interceptor from the previous
    example can be implemented to change the actual invocation:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class ChangingLoggerInterceptor {
  public static List&lt;String&gt; log(String info, @Super MemoryDatabase zuper) {
    System.out.println("Calling database");
    try {
      return zuper.load(info + " (logged access)");
    } finally {
      System.out.println("Returned from database");
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    Note that the instance that is assigned to the parameter annotated with <code>@Super</code> is of a different
    identity to the actual instance of the dynamic type! Therefore, no instance field that is accessible by means of
    the parameter reflects the actual instance's field. Furthermore, non-overridable methods of the auxiliary instance
    do not delegate their invocations but retain the original implementation what can result in absurd behavior when
    they are invoked. Finally, in case that a parameter that is annotated with <code>@Super</code> does not represent
    a super type of the relevant dynamic type, the method is not considered as a binding target for any of its
    methods.
</p>

<p>
    Because the <code>@Super</code> annotation allows for the use of any type, we might be required to provide
    information on how this type can be constructed. By default, Byte Buddy attempts to use a class's default
    constructor. This always works for interfaces which implicitly extend the <code>Object</code> type. However,
    when extending a super class of the dynamic type, this class might not even provide a default constructor.
    If this is the case or if a specific constructor should be used for creating such an auxiliary type, the
    <code>@Super</code> annotation allows to identify a different constructor by setting its parameter types as
    the annotation's <code>constructorParameters</code> property. This constructor will then be called by assigning
    the corresponding default value to each parameter. Alternatively, it is also possible to use the
    <code>Super.Instantiation.UNSAFE</code> strategy for creating classes which makes use of Java internal classes for
    creating the auxiliary type without invoking <i>any</i> constructor. However, note that this strategy is not
    necessarily portable to non-Oracle JVMs and might not longer be available in future JVM releases. As of today,
    the internal classes that are used by this unsafe instantiation strategy are however found in almost any JVM
    implementation.
</p>

<p>
    Furthermore, you might already have noticed that the above <code>LoggerInterceptor</code> declares a
    <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/declaring.html">checked
        <code>Exception</code></a>. On the other side, the instrumented source method which invokes this method does
    <i>not</i> declare any checked exception. Usually, the Java compiler would refuse to compile such an invocation.
    However, in contrast to the compiler the Java runtime does not treat checked exceptions differently than their
    unchecked counterparts and permits this invocation. For this reason, we decided to ignore checked exceptions and
    grant full flexibility in their use. However, be careful when throwing undeclared checked exceptions
    from dynamically created methods since the encounter of such an exception might confuse the users of your
    application.
</p>

<p>
    There is another caveat in the method delegation model that might have come to your attention. While static typing
    is great for implementing methods, strict types can limit the reuse of code. To understand why, consider the
    following example:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class Loop {
  public String loop(String value) { return value; }
  public int loop(int value) { return value; }
}
</pre>

<p>
    Because the methods of the above class describe two similar signatures with incompatible types, you would not
    usually be able to instrument both methods by using a single interceptor method. Instead, you would have to provide
    two different target methods with different signatures only to satisfy the static type check. To overcome this
    limitation, Byte Buddy allows to annotate methods and method parameters with <code>@RuntimeType</code> what
    instructs Byte Buddy to suspend the strict type check in favor of a runtime type casting:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class Interceptor {
  @RuntimeType
  public static Object intercept(@RuntimeType Object value) {
    System.out.println("Invoked method with: " + value);
    return value;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    Using the above target method, we are now able to provide a single interception method for both source methods.
    Note that Byte Buddy is also able to box and to unbox primitive values. However, be aware that the use of
    <code>@RuntimeType</code> comes at the cost of abandoning type safety and you might end up with a
    <code>ClassCastException</code> if you got incompatible types mixed up.
</p>

<p>
    As an equivalent to <code>@SuperCall</code>, Byte Buddy comes with a <code>@DefaultCall</code> annotation which
    allows the invocation of a default method instead of calling a method's super method. A method with this parameter
    annotation is only considered for binding if the intercepted method is as a matter of fact declared as a default
    method by an interface that is directly implemented by the instrumented type. Similarly, a <code>@SuperCall</code>
    annotation prevents a method's binding if the instrumented method does not define a non-abstract super method. If
    you however want to invoke a default method on a specific type, you can specify the <code>@DefaultCall</code>'s
    <code>targetType</code> property with a specific interface. With this specification, Byte Buddy injects a proxy
    instance which invokes the given interface type's default method, if such a method exists. Otherwise, the target
    method with the parameter annotation is not considered as a delegation target. Obviously, default method invocation
    is only available for classes that are defined in a class file version equal to Java 8 or newer. Similarly,
    in addition to the <code>@Super</code> annotation, there is a <code>@Default</code> annotation which injects
    a proxy for invoking a specific default method explicitly.
</p>

<p>
    We already mentioned that you can define and register custom annotations with any <code>MethodDelegation</code>.
    Byte Buddy comes with one annotation that is ready for use but still needs to be <i>installed</i> and registered
    explicitly. By using the <code>@Pipe</code> annotation, you can forward an intercepted method invocation to another
    instance. The <code>@Pipe</code> annotation is not preregistered with the <code>MethodDelegation</code> because
    the Java class library does not come with a suitable interface type before Java 8 which defines the
    <code>Function</code> type. Therefore, you need to explicitly provide a type with a single non-static method which
    takes an <code>Object</code> as its argument and returns another <code>Object</code> as a result. Note that you
    can still use a generic type as long as the method types are bound by the <code>Object</code> type. Of course,
    if you are using Java 8, the <code>Function</code> type is a feasible option. When invoking the method on the
    parameter's argument, Byte Buddy casts the parameter to the method's declaring type and invokes the intercepted
    method with the same arguments as the original method call. Before we look at an example, let us however define
    a custom type which you can use with Java 5 and upwards:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
interface Forwarder&lt;T, S&gt; {
  T to(S target);
}
</pre>

<p>
    Using this type, we can now implement a new solution to logging access of the above <code>MemoryDatabase</code>
    by forwarding a method invocation to an existing instance:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class ForwardingLoggerInterceptor {

  private final MemoryDatabase memoryDatabase; // constructor omitted

  public List&lt;String&gt; log(@Pipe Forwarder&lt;List&lt;String&gt;, MemoryDatabase&gt; pipe) {
    System.out.println("Calling database");
    try {
      return pipe.to(memoryDatabase);
    } finally {
      System.out.println("Returned from database");
    }
  }
}

MemoryDatabase loggingDatabase = new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(MemoryDatabase.class)
  .method(named("load")).intercept(MethodDelegation.withDefaultConfiguration()
    .withBinders(Pipe.Binder.install(Forwarder.class)))
    .to(new ForwardingLoggerInterceptor(new MemoryDatabase()))
  .make()
  .load(getClass().getClassLoader())
  .getLoaded()
  .newInstance();
</pre>

<p>
    In the above example, we only forward the invocation to another instance that we create locally. However,
    the advantage over intercepting a method by subclassing a type, is that this approach allows to enhance an
    already existing instance. Furthermore, you would normally register an interceptor on the instance level instead
    of registering a static interceptor on the class level.
</p>

<p>
    So far, we have seen a great deal of the <code>MethodDelegation</code> implementation. But before we proceed,
    we want to take a more detailed look on how Byte Buddy selects a target method. We already described how Byte
    Buddy resolves a <i>most specific</i> method by comparing parameter types but there is more to it. After Byte Buddy
    identified candidate methods that qualified for a binding to a given source method, it delegates the resolution
    to a chain of <code>AmbiguityResolver</code>s. Again, you are free to implement your own ambiguity resolvers that
    can complement or even replace Byte Buddy's defaults. Without such alterations, the ambiguity resolver chain
    attempts to identify a unique target method by applying the following rules in the same order as below:
</p>

<ul class="colored-list padded">
    <li><span>
        Methods can be assigned an explicit priority by annotating them with <code>@BindingPriority</code>. If a method
        is of a higher priority than another method, the high priority method is always preferred over that with
        lower priority. In addition, a method that is annotated by <code>@IgnoreForBinding</code> is never
        considered as a target method.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        If a source method and a target method have an identical name, this target method is preferred over
        other target methods that have a different name.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        If two methods bind the same parameters of a source method by using <code>@Argument</code>, the method with
        the most specific parameter types is considered. In this context, it does not matter if a the annotation
        is provided explicitly or implicitly by not annotating a parameter. The resolution algorithm works similar
        to the Java compiler's algorithm for resolving calls to overloaded methods. If two types are equally
        specific, the method that binds more arguments is considered as a target. If a parameter should be
        assigned an argument without considering the parameter type at this resolution stage, this is possible
        by setting the annotation's <code>bindingMechanic</code> attribute to <code>BindingMechanic.ANONYMOUS</code>.
        Furthermore, note that non-anonymous parameters need to be unique per index value on each target method for the
        resolution algorithm to work.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        If a target method has more parameters than another target method, the former method is preferred over the
        latter.
    </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
    So far, we only delegated method invocations to static methods by naming a specific class as in
    <code>MethodDelegation.to(Target.class)</code>. It is however also possible to delegate to instance methods
    or to constructors:
</p>

<ul class="colored-list padded">
    <li><span>
        By calling <code>MethodDelegation.to(new Target())</code>, it is possible to delegate method invocations
        to any of the instance methods of the <code>Target</code> class. Note that this includes methods that
        are defined anywhere in the instance's class hierarchy, including the methods that are defined in the
        <code>Object</code> class. You might want to restrict the range of candidate methods what is possible by
        applying a filter to a method delegation by calling <code>filter(ElementMatcher)</code> on any
        <code>MethodDelegation</code>. The <code>ElementMatcher</code> type is the same that was used before for
        selecting source methods within Byte Buddy's domain specific language. The instance which is the target of the
        method delegation is stored in a static field. Similarly to the definition of fixed values, this requires the
        definition of a <code>TypeInitializer</code>. Instead of storing a delegation in a static field, you can
        alternatively define the use of any field by <code>MethodDelegation.toField(String)</code>
        where the argument specifies a field name to which all method delegations are forwarded. Always
        remember to assign a value to this field before calling methods on an instance of such a dynamic class.
        Otherwise, a method delegation will result in a <code>NullPointerException</code>.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        A method delegation can be used to construct instances of a given type. By using
        <code>MethodDelegation.toConstructor(Class)</code>, any invocation of an intercepted method returns a
        new instance of the given target type.
    </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
    As you just learned, the <code>MethodDelegation</code> inspects annotations for adjusting its binding logic.
    These annotations are specific to Byte Buddy but this does not mean that the annotated classes become in any
    way dependent on Byte Buddy. Instead, the Java runtime simply ignores annotation types that cannot be found on
    the class path when a class is loaded. This implies that Byte Buddy is no longer required after a dynamic class
    is created. This means that you could load the dynamic classes and the types to which it delegates its method calls
    in another JVM process even without having Byte Buddy on the class path.
</p>

<p>
    There are several more predefined annotations that can be used with a <code>MethodDelegation</code> that we
    only want to name briefly. If you want to read more about these annotations, you can find further information in
    the in-code documentation. These annotations are:
</p>

<ul class="colored-list padded">
    <li><span>
        <code>@Empty</code>: Applying this annotation, Byte Buddy injects the parameter type's default value. For
        primitive types, this is the equivalent of the number zero, for reference types, this is <code>null</code>.
        Using this annotation is meant for voiding an interceptor's parameter.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        <code>@StubValue</code>: With this annotation, the annotated parameter is injected a stub value of the
        intercepted method. For reference-return-types and <code>void</code> methods, the value <code>null</code>
        is injected. For methods that return a primitive value, the equivalent boxing type of <code>0</code> is
        injected. This can be helpful in combination when defining a generic interceptor that returns
        a <code>Object</code> type while using a <code>@RuntimeType</code> annotation. By returning the injected
        value, the method behaves as a stub while correctly considering primitive return types.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        <code>@FieldValue</code>: This annotation locates a field in the instrumented type's class hierarchy and
        injects the field's value into the annotated parameter. If no visible field of a compatible type can be
        found for the annotated parameter, the target method is not bound.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        <code>@FieldProxy</code>: Using this annotation, Byte Buddy injects an accessor for a given field. The accessed
        field can either be specified explicitly by its name or it is derived from a getter or setter methods name,
        in case that the intercepted method represents such a method. Before this annotation can be used, it needs
        to be installed and registered explicitly, similarly to the <code>@Pipe</code> annotation.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        <code>@Morph</code>: This annotation works very similar to the <code>@SuperCall</code> annotation. However,
        using this annotation allows to specify the arguments that should be used for invoking the super method.
        Note that you should only use this annotation when you need to invoke a super method with different arguments
        than the original invocation as using the <code>@Morph</code> annotation requires a boxing and unboxing of
        all arguments. If you want to invoke a specific super method, consider using the <code>@Super</code>
        annotation for creating a type-safe proxy. Before this annotation can be used, it needs to be installed and
        registered explicitly, similarly to the <code>@Pipe</code> annotation.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        <code>@SuperMethod</code>: This annotation can only be used on parameter types that are assignable from
        <code>Method</code>. The assigned method is set to be a synthetic accessor method that allows for the invocation
        of the original code. Note that using this annotation causes a public accessor to be created for the proxy class
        that allows for the outside invocation of the super method without passing a security manager.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        <code>@DefaultMethod</code>: Similar to <code>@SuperMethod</code> but for a default method call. The default
        method is invoked on a unique type if there is only one possibility for a default method invocation. Otherwise,
        a type can be specified explicitly as an annotation property.
    </span></li>
</ul>


<h4>Calling a super method</h4>

<p>
    As the name suggests, the <code>SuperMethodCall</code> implementation can be used to invoke a method's super
    implementation. At first glance, the sole invocation of a super implementation does not seem very useful
    since this will not change an implementation but only replicate existent logic. However, by overriding a method,
    you are able to change the annotations of a method and its parameters, something we will look into in the next
    section. Another rationale for calling a super method in Java is however the definition of a constructor which must
    always invoke another constructor of either its super type or of its own type.
</p>

<p>
    So far we simply assumed that the constructors of a dynamic type would always resemble the constructors of its
    direct super type. As an example, we could call
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Object.class)
  .make()
</pre>

<p>
    to create a subclass of <code>Object</code> with a single default constructor which is defined to simply invoke its
    direct super constructor, the default constructor of <code>Object</code>. However, this behavior is not stipulated
    by Byte Buddy. Instead, the above code is a shortcut for calling
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Object.class, ConstructorStrategy.Default.IMITATE_SUPER_TYPE)
  .make()
</pre>

<p>
    where a <code>ConstructorStrategy</code> is responsible for creating a set of predefined constructors for any given
    class. Besides the above strategy which copies each visible constructor of a dynamic type's direct super class,
    there exist three other predefined strategies: one that does not create any constructor at all, one that creates a
    default constructor which is invoking the direct super class's default constructor and throws an exception if no
    such constructor exists and one that only imitates public constructors of the super type.
</p>

<p>
    Within the Java class file format, constructors do not generally differ from methods such that Byte Buddy allows
    them to be treated just as such. However, constructors are required to contain a hard-coded invocation of another
    constructor to be accepted by the Java runtime. For this reason, most predefined implementations besides
    <code>SuperMethodCall</code> will fail to create a valid Java class when applied to a constructor.
</p>

<p>
    However, by using custom implementations, you are able to define your own constructors by either implementing a
    custom <code>ConstructorStrategy</code> or by defining an individual constructor within Byte Buddy's domain specific
    language using the <code>defineConstructor</code> method. Furthermore, we are planing to add new features to Byte
    Buddy for defining more complex constructors out of the box.
</p>

<p>
    For class rebasing and class redefinition, constructors are of course simply retained what makes the specification
    of a <code>ConstructorStrategy</code> obsolete. Instead, for copying these retained constructors' (and methods')
    implementations, it is required to specify a <code>ClassFileLocator</code> which allows a lookup of the original
    class file that contains these constructor definitions. Byte Buddy does its best to identify the location of the
    original class file by itself, e.g. by querying the corresponding <code>ClassLoader</code> or by looking on an
    application's class path. When dealing with customary class loader, a lookup might however still not be successful.
    Then, a custom <code>ClassFileLocator</code> can be provided.
</p>

<h4>Calling a default method</h4>

<p>
    With its version 8 release, the Java programming language introduced
    <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html">default methods for interfaces</a>.
    In Java, a default method invocation is expressed by a similar syntax to the invocation of a super method. As an
    only disparity, a default method invocation names the interface that defines the method. This is necessary because
    a default method invocation can be ambiguous if two interfaces define a method with identical signature.
    Accordingly, Byte Buddy's <code>DefaultMethodCall</code> implementation takes a list of <i>prioritized</i>
    interfaces. When intercepting a method, the <code>DefaultMethodCall</code> invokes a default method on the
    first-mentioned interface. As an example, assume that we wanted to implement the two following interfaces:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
interface First {
  default String qux() { return "FOO"; }
}

interface Second {
  default String qux() { return "BAR"; }
}
</pre>

<p>
    If we now created a class that implements both interfaces and implemented the <code>qux</code> method to call a
    default method, this invocation could express both a call of the default method defined on the <code>First</code>
    or the <code>Second</code> interface. However, by specifying the <code>DefaultMethodCall</code> to prioritize the
    <code>First</code> interface, Byte Buddy would know that it should invoke this latter interface's method instead of
    the alternative.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
new ByteBuddy(ClassFileVersion.JAVA_V8)
  .subclass(Object.class)
  .implement(First.class)
  .implement(Second.class)
  .method(named("qux")).intercept(DefaultMethodCall.prioritize(First.class))
  .make()
</pre>

<p>
    Note that any Java class that is defined in a class file version before Java 8 does not support default methods.
    Furthermore, you should be aware that Byte Buddy imposes weaker requirements on the invokability of a default
    method compared to the Java programming language. Byte Buddy only requires a default method's interface to be
    implemented by the most-specific class in a type's hierarchy. Other than the Java programming language, it does not
    require this interface to be the most specific interface that is implemented by any super class. Finally, if you do
    not expect a ambiguous default method definitions, you can always use
    <code>DefaultMethodCall.unambiguousOnly()</code> for receiving an implementation which throws an exception on the
    discovery of an ambiguous default method invocation. This same behavior is displayed by a prioritizing
    <code>DefaultMethodCall</code> where a default method call is ambiguous between non-prioritized interfaces and no
    prioritized interface was found to define a method with a compatible signature.
</p>

<h4>Calling a specific method</h4>

<p>
    In some cases, the above <code>Implementation</code>s are not sufficient to implement more custom behavior. For
    example, one might want to implement a custom class with explicit behavior. For example, we might want to implement
    the following Java class with a constructor that does not have a super constructor with identical arguments:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
public class SampleClass {
  public SampleClass(int unusedValue) {
    super();
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    The previous <code>SuperMethodCall</code> implementation could not be used to implement this class as the
    <code>Object</code> class does not define a constructor that takes an <code>int</code> as its parameter. Instead,
    we can invoke the <code>Object</code> super constructor explicitly:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Object.class, ConstructorStrategy.Default.NO_CONSTRUCTORS)
  .defineConstructor(Arrays.&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt;asList(int.class), Visibility.PUBLIC)
  .intercept(MethodCall.invoke(Object.class.getDeclaredConstructor()))
  .make()
</pre>

<p>
    With the above code, we have created a simple subclass of <code>Object</code> that defines a single constructor
    which takes a single <code>int</code> parameter that is not used. The latter constructor is then implemented by
    an explicit method call to the <code>Object</code> super constructor.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>MethodCall</code> implementation can also be used when passing arguments. These arguments are either
    passed explicitly as a value, as a value for an instance field that needs to be set manually or as a given
    parameter value. Also, the implementation allows to invoke methods on other instances than the one being
    instrumented. Furthermore, it allows for the construction of new instances to be returned from an
    intercepted method. The documentation of the <code>MethodCall</code> class provides detailed information on these
    features.
</p>

<h4>Accessing fields</h4>

<p>
    Using the <code>FieldAccessor</code>, it is possible to implement a method to read or to write a field value. In
    order to be compatible to this implementation, a method must either:
</p>

<ul class="colored-list padded">
    <li><span>
        Have a signature similar to <code>void setBar(Foo f)</code> to define a field setter. The setter will normally
        access a field named <code>bar</code>, as it is conventional in the
        <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/spec-136004.html">Java bean
            specification</a>. In this context, the parameter type <code>Foo</code> must be a sub type this field's
        type.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        Have a signature similar to <code>Foo getBar()</code> to define a field getter. The setter will normally
        access a field named <code>bar</code>, as it is conventional in the Java bean specification. For this to be
        possible, the method's return type <code>Foo</code> must be a super type of the field's type.
    </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Creating such an implementation is trivial: Simply call <code>FieldAccessor.ofBeanProperty()</code>. However,
    if you do not want to derive a field's name from a method's name, you can still specify the field name explicitly
    by using <code>FieldAccessor.ofField(String)</code>. Using this method, the only argument defines the field's name
    that should be accessed. If required, this even allows you to define a new field if such a field does not yet
    exist. When accessing an existing field, you are able to specify the type in which a field is defined by calling
    the <code>in</code> method. In Java, it is legal to define a field in several classes of a hierarchy. In the
    process, a field of a class is <i>shadowed</i> by the field definition in its subclass. Without such an explicit
    location of the field's class, Byte Buddy will access the first field it encounters by traversing through a class
    hierarchy, starting with the most specific class.
</p>

<p>
    Let us look at an example application of the <code>FieldAccessor</code>. For this example, we assume that we
    receive some <code>UserType</code> that we want to subclass at runtime. For this purpose, we want to register an
    <code>Interceptor</code> for each instance which is represented by an interface. This way, we are able to provide
    different implementations according to our actual requirement. This latter implementation should then be
    exchangeable by calling methods of the <code>InterceptionAccessor</code> interface on the corresponding instance.
    In order to create instances of this dynamic type, we further do not want to use reflection but call a method of
    an <code>InstanceCreator</code> which serves as an object factory. The following types resemble this setup:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class UserType {
  public String doSomething() { return null; }
}

interface Interceptor {
  String doSomethingElse();
}

interface InterceptionAccessor {
  Interceptor getInterceptor();
  void setInterceptor(Interceptor interceptor);
}

interface InstanceCreator {
  Object makeInstance();
}
</pre>

<p>
    We already learned how to intercept methods of a class by using a <code>MethodDelegation</code>. Using the latter
    implementation, we can define a delegation to an instance field and name this field <code>interceptor</code>.
    Additionally, we are implementing the <code>InterceptionAccessor</code> interface and intercept all methods
    of the interface to implement accessors of this field. By defining a bean property accessor, we achieve a getter
    for <code>getInterceptor</code> and a setter for <code>setInterceptor</code>:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
Class&lt;? extends UserType&gt; dynamicUserType = new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(UserType.class)
    .method(not(isDeclaredBy(Object.class)))
    .intercept(MethodDelegation.toField("interceptor"))
  .defineField("interceptor", Interceptor.class, Visibility.PRIVATE)
  .implement(InterceptionAccessor.class).intercept(FieldAccessor.ofBeanProperty())
  .make()
  .load(getClass().getClassLoader())
  .getLoaded();
</pre>

<p>
    With the new <code>dynamicUserType</code>, we can implement the <code>InstanceCreator</code> interface to
    become a factory of this dynamic type. Again, we are using the already known <code>MethodDelegation</code> to
    call the dynamic type's default constructor:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
InstanceCreator factory = new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(InstanceCreator.class)
    .method(not(isDeclaredBy(Object.class)))
    .intercept(MethodDelegation.construct(dynamicUserType))
  .make()
  .load(dynamicUserType.getClassLoader())
  .getLoaded().newInstance();
</pre>

<p>
    Note that we need to use the <code>dynamicUserType</code>'s class loader to load the factory. Otherwise, this
    type would not be visible to the factory when it is loaded.
</p>

<p>
    With these two dynamic types, we can finally create a new instance of the dynamically enhanced
    <code>UserType</code> and define custom <code>Interceptor</code>s for its instances. Let us conclude this example
    by applying some <code>HelloWorldInterceptor</code> to a freshly created instance. Note how we are now able to do
    this without using any reflection, thanks to both the field accessor interface and the factory.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class HelloWorldInterceptor implements Interceptor {
  @Override
  public String doSomethingElse() {
    return "Hello World!";
  }
}

UserType userType = (UserType) factory.makeInstance();
((InterceptionAccessor) userType).setInterceptor(new HelloWorldInterceptor());
</pre>

<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>

<p>
    Additionally to the <code>Implementation</code>s we discussed so far, Byte Buddy includes several other
    implementations:
</p>

<ul class="colored-list padded">
    <li><span>
        A <code>StubMethod</code> implements a method to simply return the method return type's default value without
        any further action. This way, a method call can be silently suppressed. This approach can for example be used
        to implement mock types. The default value of any primitive type is zero or the zero character respectively.
        Methods that return a reference type return <code>null</code> as their default.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        The <code>ExceptionMethod</code> can be used to implement a method to only throw an exception. As mentioned
        before, it is possible to throw checked exceptions from any method even if a method does not declare this
        exception.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        The <code>Forwarding</code> implementations allows to simply forward a method call to another instance
        of the same type as the declaring type of an intercepted method. The same result can be achieved using a
        <code>MethodDelegation</code>. However, by <code>Forwarding</code> a simpler delegation model is applied
        which can cover use cases where no target method discovery is required.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        The <code>InvocationHandlerAdapter</code> allows to use existing <code>InvocationHandler</code>s from the
        for the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html">proxy classes</a>
        that ship with the Java Class Library.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        The <code>InvokeDynamic</code> implementation allows to bind a method dynamically at runtime using
        <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/invoke/package-summary.html">a bootstrap methods</a>
        which are accessible from Java 7 on.
    </span></li>
</ul>

    <h2>Annotations</h2>

    <p>
        We just learned how Byte Buddy relies on annotations for providing some of its functionality. And Byte Buddy is
        by far not the only Java application with an annotation-based API. In order to integrate dynamically created
        types with such applications, Byte Buddy allows to define annotations for its created types and their members.
        Before looking into the details of assigning annotations to dynamically created types, let us look at an example
        of annotating a runtime class:
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@interface RuntimeDefinition { }

class RuntimeDefinitionImpl implements RuntimeDefinition {
  @Override
  public Class&lt;? extends Annotation&gt; annotationType() {
    return RuntimeDefinition.class;
  }
}

new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Object.class)
  .annotateType(new RuntimeDefinitionImpl())
  .make();

    <p>
        As insinuated by Java's <code>@interface</code> keyword, annotations are internally represented as interface
        types. As a consequence, annotations can be implemented by a Java class just like an ordinary interface. The
        only difference to implementing an interface is an annotation's implicit <code>annotationType</code> method
        which determines the annotation type a class represents. The latter method usually returns the implemented
        annotation type's class literal. Other than that, any annotation property is implemented as if it was an
        interface method. However, note that an annotation's default values need to be repeated by an annotation
        method's implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Defining annotations for a dynamically created class can be in particularly important when a class should serve
        as a subclass proxy for another class. A subclass proxy is often used to implement
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-cutting_concern">cross-cutting concerns</a> where the subclass
        should mimic the original class as transparently as possible. However, annotations on a class are not retained
        for its subclasses as long as this behavior is explicitly required by defining an annotation to be
        <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/Inherited.html"><code>@Inherited</code></a>.
        Using Byte Buddy, creating subclass proxies that retain their base class's annotations is easy by invoking
        the <code>attribute</code> method of Byte Buddy's domain specific language. This methods expects a
        <code>TypeAttributeAppender</code> as its argument. A type attribute appender offers a flexible way for defining
        the annotations of a dynamically created class, based on its base class. For example, by passing a
        <code>TypeAttributeAppender.ForSuperType</code>, a class's annotations are copied to its dynamically created
        subclasses. Note that annotations and type attribute appenders are additive and no annotation type must be
        defined more than once for any class.
    </p>

    <p>
        Method and field annotations are defined similarly to type annotations which we just discussed. A method
        annotation can be defined as a conclusive statement in Byte Buddy's domain specific language for implementing a
        method. Likewise, a field can be annotated after its definition. Again, let us look at an example:
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Object.class)
    .annotateType(new RuntimeDefinitionImpl())
  .method(named("toString"))
    .intercept(SuperMethodCall.INSTANCE)
    .annotateMethod(new RuntimeDefinitionImpl())
  .defineField("foo", Object.class)
    .annotateField(new RuntimeDefinitionImpl())
</pre>

    <p>
        The above code example overrides the <code>toString</code> method and annotates the overridden method with
        <code>RuntimeDefinition</code>. Furthermore, the created type defines a field <code>foo</code> that carries the
        same annotation and also defines the latter annotation on the created type itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        By default, a <code>ByteBuddy</code> configuration does not predefine any annotations for a dynamically created
        type or type member. However, this behavior can be altered by providing a default
        <code>TypeAttributeAppender</code>, <code>MethodAttributeAppender</code> or <code>FieldAttributeAppender</code>.
        Note that such default appenders are not additive but replace their former values.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sometimes, it is desirable to not load an annotation type or the types of any of its properties when defining
        a class. For this purpose, it is possible to use the <code>AnnotationDescription.Builder</code> which
        offers a fluent interface for defining an annotation without triggering class loading but at the costs
        of type safety. All annotation properties are however evaluated at runtime.
    </p>

    <p>
        By default, Byte Buddy includes any property of an annotation into a class file, including default properties
        that are specified implicitly by a <code>default</code> value. This behavior can however be customized by
        providing an <code>AnnotationFilter</code> to a <code>ByteBuddy</code> instance.
    </p>

<h4>Type annotations</h4>

<p>
    Byte Buddy exposes and writes type annotations as they were introduced as a part of Java 8. Type annotations are
    accessible as declared annotations by the any <code>TypeDescription.Generic</code> instance. If a type annotation
    should be added to a type of a generic field or method, an annotated type can be generated using a
    <code>TypeDescription.Generic.Builder</code>.
</p>

<h4>Attribute appenders</h4>

<p>
    A Java class file can include any custom information as a so-called attribute. Such attributes can be included using
    Byte Buddy by using an <code>*AttributeAppender</code> for a type, field or method. Attribute appenders can however
    also be used for defining methods based on information that is provided by the intercepted type, field or method. For
    example, it is possible to copy all annotations of an intercepted method when overriding a method in a subclass:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class AnnotatedMethod {
  @SomeAnnotation
  void bar() { }
}
new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(AnnotatedMethod.class)
  .method(named("bar"))
  .intercept(StubMethod.INSTANCE)
  .attribute(MethodAttributeAppender.ForInstrumentedMethod.INSTANCE)
</pre>

<p>
    The above code overrides the <code>bar</code> method of the <code>AnnotatedMethod</code> class but copies all
    annotations of the overridden method, including annotations on parameters or types.
</p>

<p>
    When a class is redefined or rebased, the same rule might not apply. By default, <code>ByteBuddy</code> is
    configured to preserve any annotations of a rebased or redefined method, even if the method is intercepted
    as above. This behavior can however be changed such that Byte Buddy discards any preexisting annotations by
    setting the <code>AnnotationRetention</code> strategy to <code>DISABLED</code>.
</p>

<h2>Custom method implementations</h2>

<p>
    In the previous sections, we described Byte Buddy's standard API. None of the features described so far
    requires knowledge or the explicit expression of Java byte code. However, if you require to create custom
    byte code, you can do so by directly accessing the API of <a href="http://asm.ow2.org/">ASM</a>, a
    low-level byte code library on top of which Byte Buddy is built. However, note that different versions of ASM
    are not compatible to another such that you need to repackage Byte Buddy into your own namespace when releasing
    your code. Otherwise, your application might introduce incompatibilities to other uses of Byte Buddy when
    another dependency is expecting a different version of Byte Buddy which is based on a different version of ASM. You
    can find detailed information on maintaining a dependency on Byte Buddy
    <a href="/#dependency">on the front page</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The ASM library comes with
    <a href="https://asm.ow2.io/asm4-guide.pdf">an excellent documentation</a> of Java byte
    code and on the use of the library. Therefore, we want to refer you to this documentation in case that you want
    to learn in detail about Java byte code and ASM's API. Instead, we are only going to provide a brief introduction
    to the JVM's execution model and Byte Buddy's adaption of ASM's API.
</p>

<p>
    Any Java class file is constituted by several segments. The core segments can be categorized roughly as
    follows:
</p>

<ul class="colored-list padded">
    <li><span>
        <b>Base data</b>: A class file references the class's name as well as the name of its superclass and its
        implemented interfaces. Additionally, a class file contains different meta data as for example the class's
        Java version number, its annotations or the name of the source file the compiler processed for creating
        the class.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
        <b>Constant pool</b>: A class's constant pool is a collection of values that are referenced by a member or
        an annotation of this class. Among those values, the constant pool stores for example primitive values and
        strings that are created by some literal expression in the class's source code. Furthermore, the constant pool
        stores the names of all types and methods that are used within the class.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
         <b>Field list</b>: A Java class file contains a list of all fields that are declared in this class.
         Additionally to the type, name and the modifiers of a field, the class file stores the annotations of each
         field.
    </span></li>
    <li><span>
         <b>Method list</b>: Similar to the list of fields, a Java class file contains a list of all declared
         methods. Other than fields, non-abstract methods are additionally described by an array of byte-encoded
        instructions that describe the method body. These instructions represent the so-called Java byte code.
    </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Fortunately, the ASM library takes full responsibility of establishing an applicable constant pool when creating a
    class. With this, the only non-trivial element remains the description of a method's implementation which is
    represented by an array of execution instructions, each encoded as a single byte. These instructions are processed
    by a virtual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine">stack machine</a> on the method's invocation. For
    a simple example, let us consider a method that calculates and returns the sum of the two primitive integers
    <code>10</code> and <code>50</code>. This method's Java byte code would look as follows:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
LDC     10  // stack contains 10
LDC     50  // stack contains 10, 50
IADD        // stack contains 60
IRETURN     // stack is empty
</pre>

<p>
    The above <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode_instruction_listings">mnemonic of an array of
    Java byte code</a> starts off by pushing both numbers onto the stack by using the <code>LDC</code> instruction.
    Note how this execution order differs from the order that is expressed in Java source code where the addition would
    be written as the infix notation <code>10 + 50</code>. However, the latter order cannot be processed by a stack
    machine where any instruction like <code>+</code> can only access the upper most values that are currently found on
    the stack. This addition is expressed by <code>IADD</code> which consumes the two upmost stack values which it both
    expects to be primitive integers. In the process, it adds these two values and pushes the result back onto the top
    of the stack. Finally, the <code>IRETURN</code> statement consumes this calculation result and returns it from the
    method, leaving us with an empty stack.
</p>

<p>
    We already mentioned that any primitive value that is referenced in a method is stored in the class's constant
    pool. This is also true for the numbers <code>50</code> and <code>10</code> which are referenced in the above
    method. Any value in the constant pool is assigned an index with the length of two bytes. Let us assume
    that the numbers <code>10</code> and <code>50</code> were stored at the indexes <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>.
    Together with the byte values of the above mnemonic which are <code>0x12</code> for <code>LDC</code>,
    <code>0x60</code> for <code>IADD</code> and <code>0xAC</code> for <code>IRETURN</code>, we now know how express
    the above method as raw byte instructions:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint pln-as-lit">
12 00 01
12 00 02
60
AC
</pre>

<p>
    For a compiled class, this exact byte sequence could be found in the class file. However, this description does
    not yet suffice to fully define a method's implementation. In order to accelerate a Java application's
    runtime execution, each method is required to inform the Java virtual machine about the required size for its
    execution stack. For the above method which comes without branches, this is rather easy to determine as we already
    saw that there will be at most two values on the stack. However, for more complex methods, providing this
    information can easily become a complex task. And to make things worse, stack values can be of different size.
    Both <code>long</code> and <code>double</code> values consume two slots while any other value consumes one.
    As if this wasn't enough, the Java virtual machine also requires information about the size of all local variables
    within a method's body. All such variables in a method are stored in an array which also includes any method
    parameter and the <code>this</code> reference for non-static methods. Again, <code>long</code> and
    <code>double</code> values consume two slots in this array.
</p>

<p>
    Evidently, keeping track of all this information makes the manual assembly of Java byte code tedious and
    error-prone which is why Byte Buddy provides a simplifying abstraction. Within Byte Buddy, any stack instruction is
    contained by an implementation of the <code>StackManipulation</code> interface. Any implementation of a stack
    manipulation combines an instruction to alter a given stack and information on the size impact of this instruction.
    Any number of such instructions can then easily be conflated to a common instruction. To demonstrate this, let us
    first implement a <code>StackManipulation</code> for the <code>IADD</code> instruction:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
enum IntegerSum implements StackManipulation {

  INSTANCE; // singleton

  @Override
  public boolean isValid() {
    return true;
  }

  @Override
  public Size apply(MethodVisitor methodVisitor,
                    Implementation.Context implementationContext) {
    methodVisitor.visitInsn(Opcodes.IADD);
    return new Size(-1, 0);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    From the above <code>apply</code> method, we learn that this stack manipulation executes the <code>IADD</code>
    instruction by invoking the related method on ASM's method visitor. Furthermore, the method expresses that the
    instruction reduces the current stack <code>Size</code> by one slot. The second argument of the created
    <code>Size</code> instance is <code>0</code> what expresses that this instruction does not require a specific
    minimal stack size for calculating interim results. Furthermore, any <code>StackManipulation</code> can express to
    be invalid. This behavior can be used for more complex stack manipulation as for example object assignments which
    might break a type constraint. We will look at an example of an invalid stack manipulation later in this section.
    Finally, note that we describe the stack manipulation as a
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern#The_Enum_way">singleton enumeration</a>. Using such
    immutable, functional descriptions of stack manipulations proved to be a good practice for Byte Buddy's internal
    implementation and we can only recommend you to follow the same approach.
</p>

<p>
    By combining the above <code>IntegerSum</code> with the predefined <code>IntegerConstant</code> and the
    <code>MethodReturn</code> stack manipulations, we can now implement a method. Within Byte Buddy, a method
    implementation is contained by a <code>ByteCodeAppender</code> which we implement as follows:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
enum SumMethod implements ByteCodeAppender {

  INSTANCE; // singleton

  @Override
  public Size apply(MethodVisitor methodVisitor,
                    Implementation.Context implementationContext,
                    MethodDescription instrumentedMethod) {
    if (!instrumentedMethod.getReturnType().asErasure().represents(int.class)) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException(instrumentedMethod + " must return int");
    }
    StackManipulation.Size operandStackSize = new StackManipulation.Compound(
      IntegerConstant.forValue(10),
      IntegerConstant.forValue(50),
      IntegerSum.INSTANCE,
      MethodReturn.INTEGER
    ).apply(methodVisitor, implementationContext);
    return new Size(operandStackSize.getMaximalSize(),
                    instrumentedMethod.getStackSize());
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    Again, the custom <code>ByteCodeAppender</code> is implemented as a singleton enumeration.
</p>

<p>
    Before implementing the desired method, we first validate that the instrumented method really returns a primitive
    integer. Otherwise, the created class would be rejected by the JVM's validator. Then we load the two numbers
    <code>10</code> and <code>50</code> onto the execution stack, apply the summation of these values and return the
    calculation result. By wrapping all these instructions with a compound stack manipulation, we can conclusively
    retrieve the aggregated stack size that is required to perform this chain of stack manipulations. Finally, we
    return the overall size requirements of this method. The first argument of the returned
    <code>ByteCodeAppender.Size</code> reflects the required size for the execution stack which we just mentioned to
    be contained by the <code>StackManipulation.Size</code>. Additionally, the second argument reflects the required
    size for the local variable array which here simply resembles the required size for the method's parameters and
    a possible <code>this</code> reference since we did not define any local variables of our own.
</p>

<p>
    With this implementation of our summation method, we are now ready to provide a custom <code>Implementation</code>
    for this method which we can provide to Byte Buddy's domain specific language:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
enum SumImplementation implements Implementation {

  INSTANCE; // singleton

  @Override
  public InstrumentedType prepare(InstrumentedType instrumentedType) {
    return instrumentedType;
  }

  @Override
  public ByteCodeAppender appender(Target implementationTarget) {
    return SumMethod.INSTANCE;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    Any <code>Implementation</code> is queried in two stages. First, an implementation gets the chance to
    alter the created class by adding additional fields or methods in the <code>prepare</code> method. Furthermore,
    the preparation allows an implementation to register a <code>TypeInitializer</code> which we learned about in
    a previous section. If no such preparations are required, it suffices to return the unaltered
    <code>InstrumentedType</code> which is provided as the argument. Note that an <code>Implementation</code> should
    not normally return an individual instance of an instrumented type but should call the instrumented type's appender
    methods which are all prefixed by <code>with</code>. After any <code>Implementation</code> for a particular class
    creation is prepared, the <code>appender</code> method is invoked for retrieving a <code>ByteCodeAppender</code>.
    This appender is then queried for any method that was selected for interception by the given implementation and
    also for any method that was registered during the implementation's invocation of the <code>prepare</code> method.
</p>

<p>
    Note that Byte Buddy only invokes each <code>Implementation</code>'s <code>prepare</code> and <code>appender</code>
    methods a single time during the creation process of any class. This is guaranteed no matter how many times an
    implementation is registered for use in a class's creation. This way, an <code>Implementation</code> can avoid to
    verify if a field or method is already defined. In the process, Byte Buddy compares <code>Implementation</code>s
    instances by their <code>hashCode</code> and <code>equals</code> methods. In general, any class that is used by
    Byte Buddy should provide meaningful implementations of these methods. The fact that enumerations come with such
    implementations per definition is another good reason for their use.
</p>

<p>
    With all this, let us see the <code>SumImplementation</code> in action:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
abstract class SumExample {
  public abstract int calculate();
}

new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(SumExample.class)
    .method(named("calculate"))
    .intercept(SumImplementation.INSTANCE)
  .make()
</pre>

<p>
    Congratulations! You just extended Byte Buddy to implement a custom method that computes and returns the sum of
    <code>10</code> and <code>50</code>. Of course, this example implementation is not of much practical use. However,
    more complex implementations can be implemented easily on top of this infrastructure. After all, if you feel that
    you created something handy, please consider to <a href="/develop">contribute your implementation</a>. We are
    looking forward to hearing from you!
</p>

<p>
    Before we move on to customizing some other components of Byte Buddy, we should briefly discuss the use of jump
    instructions and the matter of the so-called Java stack frames. Since Java 6, any jump instruction which are used
    to implement for example the <code>if</code> or the <code>while</code> statements require some additional
    information in order to accelerate the JVM's verification process. This additional information is called a
    <i>stack map frame</i>. A stack map frame contains information about all values that are found on the execution
    stack at any target of a jump instruction. By providing this information, the JVM's verifier saves some work
    which is now however now left to us. For more complex jump instructions, providing correct stack map frames is a
    rather difficult task and many code generation frameworks have quite some trouble to always create correct stack
    map frames. So how do we deal with this matter? As a matter of fact, we simply don't. It is Byte Buddy's philosophy
    that code generation should only be used as the glue between a type hierarchy that is unknown at compile time and
    custom code that needs to be injected into these types. The actual code that is generated should therefore remain
    as confined as possible. Wherever possible, conditional statements should rather be implemented and compiled in a
    JVM language of your choice and then be bound to a given method by using a minimalistic implementation. A nice
    side effect of this approach is that Byte Buddy's users can work with normal Java code and use their accustomed
    tools like debuggers or IDE code navigators. None of this would be possible with generated code which does not have
    a source code representation. However, if you really need to create byte code with jump instructions, make sure to
    add the correct stack map frames using ASM since Byte Buddy will not automatically include them for you.
</p>

<h4>Creating a custom assigner</h4>

<p>
    In a previous section, we discussed that Byte Buddy's built in <code>Implementation</code>s rely on an
    <code>Assigner</code> in order to assign values to variables. In this process, an <code>Assigner</code> is able to
    apply a transformation of one value to another by emitting an appropriate <code>StackManipulation</code>. Doing so,
    Byte Buddy's built-in assigners provide for example auto-boxing of primitive values and their wrapper types.
    In the most trivial case, a value is assignable to a variable <i>as is</i>. In some cases, an assignment may
    however not be possible at all what can be expressed by returning an invalid <code>StackManipulation</code> from an
    assigner. A canonical implementation of an invalid assignment is provided by Byte Buddy's
    <code>IllegalStackManipulation</code> class.
</p>

<p>
    To demonstrate the use of a custom assigner, we are now going to implement an <code>Assigner</code> that only
    assigns values to <code>String</code>-typed variables by calling the <code>toString</code> method on any
    value it receives:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
enum ToStringAssigner implements Assigner {

  INSTANCE; // singleton

  @Override
  public StackManipulation assign(TypeDescription.Generic source,
                                  TypeDescription.Generic target,
                                  Assigner.Typing typing) {
    if (!source.isPrimitive() && target.represents(String.class)) {
      MethodDescription toStringMethod = new TypeDescription.ForLoadedType(Object.class)
        .getDeclaredMethods()
        .filter(named("toString"))
        .getOnly();
      return MethodInvocation.invoke(toStringMethod).virtual(sourceType);
    } else {
      return StackManipulation.Illegal.INSTANCE;
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    The above implementation first validates that the input value is not of a primitive type and that the target
    variable type is of a <code>String</code> type. If these conditions are not fulfilled, the <code>Assigner</code>
    emits an <code>IllegalStackManipulation</code> to render the attempted assignment invalid. Otherwise, we identify
    the <code>Object</code> type's <code>toString</code> method by its name. We then use Byte Buddy's
    <code>MethodInvocation</code> to create a <code>StackManipulation</code> that calls this method virtually on the
    source type. Finally, we can integrate this custom <code>Assigner</code> with for example Byte Buddy's
    <code>FixedValue</code> implementation as follows:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Object.class)
  .method(named("toString"))
    .intercept(FixedValue.value(42)
      .withAssigner(new PrimitiveTypeAwareAssigner(ToStringAssigner.INSTANCE),
                    Assigner.Typing.STATIC))
  .make()
</pre>

<p>
    When the <code>toString</code> method is called on an instance of the above type, it will return the string value
    <code>42</code>. This is only possible by using our custom assigner which converts the <code>Integer</code> type
    to a <code>String</code> by invoking the <code>toString</code> method. Note that we additionally wrapped
    the custom assigner with the built-in <code>PrimitiveTypeAwareAssigner</code> which performs an auto-boxing of
    the provided primitive <code>int</code> to its wrapper type before delegating the assignment of this wrapped
    primitive value to its inner assigner. Other built-in assigners are the <code>VoidAwareAssigner</code> and the
    <code>ReferenceTypeAwareAssigner</code>. Always remember to implement meaningful <code>hashCode</code> and
    <code>equals</code> methods for your custom assigners since those methods are normally called from their
    counterparts in the <code>Implementation</code> that is making use of a given assigner. Again, by implementing
    an assigner as a singleton enumeration, we avoid doing this manually.
</p>

<h4>Creating a custom parameter binder</h4>

<p>
    We already mentioned in a previous section that it is possible to extend the <code>MethodDelegation</code>
    implementation to process user-defined annotations. For this purpose, we need to provide a custom
    <code>ParameterBinder</code> which knows how to handle a given annotation. As an example, we want to define
    an annotation with the purpose to simply inject a fixed string into the annotated parameter. First, we define such
    a <code>StringValue</code> annotation:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@interface StringValue {
  String value();
}
</pre>

<p>
    We need to make sure that the annotation is visible at runtime by setting the appropriate
    <code>RuntimePolicy</code>. Otherwise, the annotation is not retained at runtime and Byte Buddy does not have a
    chance to discover it. Doing so, the above <code>value</code> property contains the string which is assigned to
    the annotated parameter as a value.
</p>

<p>
    With our custom annotation, we need to create a corresponding <code>ParameterBinder</code> which is able to create
    a <code>StackManipulation</code> which expresses the binding for this parameter. This parameter binder is invoked
    each time, its corresponding annotation is discovered on a parameter by the <code>MethodDelegation</code>.
    Implementing a custom parameter binder for our example annotation is straight forward:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
enum StringValueBinder
    implements TargetMethodAnnotationDrivenBinder.ParameterBinder&lt;StringValue&gt; {

  INSTANCE; // singleton

  @Override
  public Class&lt;StringValue&gt; getHandledType() {
    return StringValue.class;
  }

  @Override
  public MethodDelegationBinder.ParameterBinding&lt;?&gt; bind(AnnotationDescription.Loaded&lt;StringValue&gt; annotation,
                                                         MethodDescription source,
                                                         ParameterDescription target,
                                                         Implementation.Target implementationTarget,
                                                         Assigner assigner,
                                                         Assigner.Typing typing) {
    if (!target.getType().asErasure().represents(String.class)) {
      throw new IllegalStateException(target + " makes illegal use of @StringValue");
    }
    StackManipulation constant = new TextConstant(annotation.loadSilent().value());
    return new MethodDelegationBinder.ParameterBinding.Anonymous(constant);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
    Initially, the parameter binder makes sure that the <code>target</code> parameter is actually a
    <code>String</code> type. If this is not the case, we will throw an exception to inform the annotation's user
    of his illegal placing of this annotation. Otherwise, we simply create a <code>TextConstant</code> which represents
    the loading of a constant pool string onto the execution stack. This <code>StackManipulation</code> is then wrapped
    as an anonymous <code>ParameterBinding</code> which is finally returned from the method. Alternatively, you could
    have provided either a <code>Unique</code> or an <code>Illegal</code> parameter binding. A unique binding is
    identified by any object which allows to retrieve this binding from an <code>AmbiguityResolver</code>. In a later
    step, such a resolver is able to look up if a parameter binding was registered with some unique identifier and can
    then decide if this binding is superior to another successfully bound method. With an illegal binding, one can
    instruct Byte Buddy that a specific pair of a <code>source</code> and a <code>target</code> method is incompatible
    and cannot be bound together.
</p>

<p>
    This already is all the information that is required for using a custom annotation with a
    <code>MethodDelegation</code> implementation. After receiving a <code>ParameterBinding</code>, it makes sure that
    its value is bound to the correct parameter or it will discard the current pair of a <code>source</code> and
    <code>target</code> method as unbindable. Furthermore, it will allow <code>AmbiguityResolver</code>s to look up
    unique bindings. Finally, let us put this custom annotation in action:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
class ToStringInterceptor {
  public static String makeString(@StringValue("Hello!") String value) {
    return value;
  }
}

new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Object.class)
  .method(named("toString"))
    .intercept(MethodDelegation.withDefaultConfiguration()
      .withBinders(StringValueBinder.INSTANCE)
      .to(ToStringInterceptor.class))
  .make()
</pre>

<p>
    Note that by specifying the <code>StringValueBinder</code> as the only parameter binder, we replace all defaults.
    Alternatively, we could have appended the parameter binder to those that are already registered. With only one
    possible target method in the <code>ToStringInterceptor</code>, the dynamic class's intercepted
    <code>toString</code> method is bound to the latter method's invocation. When the target method is invoked,
    Byte Buddy assigns the annotation's string value as the target method's only parameter.
