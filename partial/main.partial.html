                    Byte Buddy is a code generation and manipulation library for creating and modifying Java classes during
                    the runtime of a Java application and without the help of a compiler. Other than the code generation
                    utilities that <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html">ship with the Java Class Library</a>,
                    Byte Buddy allows the creation of arbitrary classes and is not limited to implementing interfaces for
                    the creation of runtime proxies. Furthermore, Byte Buddy offers a convenient API for changing classes
                    either manually, using a Java agent or during a build.

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            In order to use Byte Buddy, one does not require an understanding of Java byte code or the
            <a data-ng-href="{{classFileFormatUrl}}">class file format</a>.
            In contrast, Byte Buddy's API aims for code that is concise and easy to understand for
            everybody. Nevertheless, Byte Buddy remains fully customizable down to the possibility of defining custom
            byte code. Furthermore, the API was designed to be as non-intrusive as possible and as a result, Byte
            Buddy does not leave any trace in the classes that were created by it. For this reason, the generated
            classes can exist without requiring Byte Buddy on the class path. Because of this feature, Byte Buddy's
            mascot was chosen to be a ghost.
        </p>

        <p>
            Byte Buddy is written in Java {{javaVersion}} but supports the generation of classes for any Java version. Byte Buddy is a
            light-weight library and only depends on the visitor API of the Java byte code parser library
            <a data-ng-href="{{classFileFormatUrl}}">ASM</a> which does itself
            <a href="https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/ow2/asm/asm/4.2/asm-4.2.pom">not require any
                further dependencies</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            At first sight, runtime code generation can appear to be some sort of black magic that should be avoided and
            only few developers write applications that explicitly generate code during their runtime. However, this
            picture changes when creating libraries that need to interact with arbitrary code and unknown type
            hierarchies. In this context, a library implementer must often choose between either requiring a user to
            implement library-proprietary interfaces or to generate code at runtime when the user's type hierarchy
            becomes first known to the library. Many known libraries such as for example <i>Spring</i> or
            <i>Hibernate</i> choose the latter approach which is popular among their users under the term of using
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object"><i>Plain Old Java Objects</i></a>. As a result,
            code generation has become an ubiquitous concept in the Java space. Byte Buddy is an attempt to innovate
            the runtime creation of Java types in order to provide a better tool set to those relying on such
            functionality.

        <p>
            Saying <code>Hello World</code> with Byte Buddy is as easy as it can get. Any creation of a Java class
            starts with an instance of the <code>ByteBuddy</code> class which represents a configuration for creating
            new types:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
Class&lt;?&gt; dynamicType = new ByteBuddy()
  .subclass(Object.class)
  .method(ElementMatchers.named("toString"))
  .intercept(FixedValue.value("Hello World!"))
  .make()
  .load(getClass().getClassLoader())
  .getLoaded();

assertThat(dynamicType.newInstance().toString(), is("Hello World!"));
</pre>

        <p>
            The default <code>ByteBuddy</code> configuration which is used in the above example creates a Java
            class in the newest version of the class file format that is understood by the processing Java
            virtual machine. As hopefully obvious from the example code, the created type will extend the
            <code>Object</code> class and overrides its <code>toString</code> method which should return a
            fixed value of <code>Hello World!</code>. The method to be overridden is identified by a so-called
            <code>ElementMatcher</code>. In the above example, a predefined element matcher
            <code>named(String)</code> is used which identifies methods by their exact names. Byte Buddy comes
            with numerous predefined and well-tested matchers which are collected in the
            <code>ElementMatchers</code> class and which can be easily composed. The creation of custom matchers
            is however as simple as implementing the
            (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/FunctionalInterface.html">functional</a>)
            <code>ElementMatcher</code> interface.
        </p>

        <p>
            For implementing the <code>toString</code> method, the <code>FixedValue</code> class defines a constant
            return value for the overridden method. Defining a constant value is only one example of many method
            interceptors that ship with Byte Buddy. By implementing the <code>Implementation</code> interface, a
            method could however even be defined by custom byte code.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, the described Java class is created and then loaded into the Java virtual machine. For this
            purpose, a target class loader is required which is read from the surrounding class. Eventually, we
            can convince ourselves of the result by calling the <code>toString</code> method on an instance of the
            created class and finding the return value to represent the constant value we expected.
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, Byte Buddy is capable of much more sophisticated class generation. Furthermore, Byte Buddy is
            not limited to creating subclasses but can transform existing code. Byte Buddy also offers a convenient
            API for defining so-called
            <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html">Java agents</a>
            which allow code transformations during the runtime of any Java application. For a taste of such features,

        <h2>Dependency maintenance</h2>

        <p>
            Byte Buddy is written on top of <a data-ng-href="{{asmUrl}}">ASM</a>, a mature and well-tested
            library for reading and writing compiled Java classes. In order to allow for advanced type
            manipulations, Byte Buddy is intentionally exposing the ASM API to its users. Of course, the direct
            use of ASM remains fully optional and most users will most likely never require it. This choice was
            made such that a user of Byte Buddy is not restrained to its higher-level functionality but can
            implement custom implementations without a fuss when it is necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
            ASM has previously changed its public API but added a mechanism for API compatibility starting with version
            4 of the library. In order to avoid version conflicts with such older versions, Byte Buddy repackages the
            ASM dependency into its own namespace. If you want to use ASM directly, use the <code>byte-buddy-dep</code>
            artifact that offers a version of Byte Buddy with an explicit dependency to ASM. When doing so, you <b>must</b>
            repackage <b>both</b> Byte Buddy and ASM into your namespace to avoid version conflicts.
