/**
 * This implementation delegates an method call to another method which can either be {@code static} by providing
 * a reference to a {@link java.lang.Class} or an instance method when another object is provided. The potential
 * targets of the method delegation can further be filtered by applying a filter. The method delegation can be
 * customized by invoking the {@code MethodDelegation}'s several builder methods.
 * <h3>Without any customization, the method delegation will work as follows:</h3>
 * <span style="text-decoration: underline">Binding an instrumented method to a given delegate method</span>
 * <p>&nbsp;</p>
 * A method will be bound parameter by parameter. Considering a method {@code Foo#bar} being bound to a method
 * {@code Qux#baz}, the method delegation will be decided on basis of the following annotations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Argument}:
 * This annotation will bind the {@code n}-th parameter of {@code Foo#bar} to that parameter of {@code Qux#baz}that
 * is annotated with this annotation where {@code n} is the obligatory argument of the {@code @Argument} annotation.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.AllArguments}:
 * This annotation will assign a collection of all parameters of {@code Foo#bar} to that parameter of {@code Qux#baz}
 * that is annotated with {@code AllArguments}.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.This}: A parameter
 * of {@code Qux#baz} that is annotated with {@code This} will be assigned the instance that is instrumented for
 * a non-static method.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Super}: A parameter that is annotated with
 * this annotation is assigned a proxy that allows calling an instrumented type's super methods.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Default}: A parameter that is annotated with
 * this annotation is assigned a proxy that allows calling an instrumented type's directly implemented interfaces'
 * default methods.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.SuperCall}: A parameter
 * of {@code Qux#baz} that is annotated with {@code SuperCall} will be assigned an instance of a type implementing both
 * {@link java.lang.Runnable} and {@link java.util.concurrent.Callable} which will invoke the instrumented method on the
 * invocation of either interface's method. The call is made using the original arguments of the method invocation.
 * The return value is only emitted for the {@link java.util.concurrent.Callable#call()} method which additionally
 * requires to catch any unchecked exceptions that might be thrown by the original method's implementation. If a
 * source method is abstract, using this annotation excludes the method with this parameter annotation from being bound
 * to this source method.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.DefaultCall}:
 * This annotation is similar to the {@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.SuperCall}
 * annotation but it invokes a default method that is compatible to this method. If a source method does not represent
 * a default method, using this annotation excludes the method with this parameter annotation from being bound to this
 * source method.</li>
 * <li>The {@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.SuperMethod} or
 * {@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.DefaultMethod} annotations can be used on any parameter type
 * that is assignable from the {@link java.lang.reflect.Method} type. the parameter is bound a method instance that
 * allows for the reflective invocation of a super or default method. Note that this method is not equal to the intercepted
 * method but represents a synthetic accessor method. Using this annotation also causes this accessor to be {@code public}
 * which allows its outside invocation without any access checks by a security manager.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Origin}: A parameter of
 * {@code Qux#baz} that is annotated with {@code Origin} is assigned a reference to either a {@link java.lang.reflect.Method},
 * a {@link java.lang.reflect.Constructor}, a {@code java.lang.reflect.Executable} or a {@link java.lang.Class} instance.
 * A {@code Method}-typed, {@code Constructor} or {@code Executable} parameter is assigned a reference to the original
 * method that is instrumented. A {@code Class}-typed parameter is assigned the type of the caller. Furthermore, {@code MethodType}
 * and {@code MethodHandle} parameters are also supported. When using the annotation on a {@link java.lang.String} type,
 * the intercepted method's {@code toString} value is injected. The same holds for a parameter of type {@code int} that receives
 * the modifiers of the instrumented method.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.StubValue}: Assigns the (boxed) default value of the
 * intercepted method's return type to the parameter. If the return type is {@code void}, {@code null} is assigned.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Empty}: Assigns the parameter type's
 * default value, i.e. {@code null} for a reference type or zero for primitive types. This is an opportunity to
 * ignore a parameter.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Pipe}: A parameter that is annotated
 * with this annotation is assigned a proxy for forwarding the source method invocation to another instance of the
 * same type as the declaring type of the intercepted method. <b>This annotation needs to be installed and explicitly
 * registered before it can be used.</b> See the {@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Pipe}
 * annotation's documentation for further information on how this can be done.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Morph}: The morph annotation is similar to
 * the {@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.SuperCall} annotation but allows to
 * explicitly define and therewith alter the arguments that are handed to the super method. <b>This annotation needs
 * to be installed and explicitly registered before it can be used.</b> See the documentation to the annotation for
 * further information.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.FieldValue}: Allows to access a field's value at the time
 * of the method invocation. The field's value is directly assigned to the annotated parameter.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.FieldProxy}: Allows to access fields via getter
 * and setter proxies. <b>This annotation needs to be installed and explicitly registered before it can be used.</b>
 * Note that any field access requires boxing such that a use of {@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.FieldAccessor} in
 * combination with {@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.MethodDelegation#andThen(Implementation)} might be a more
 * performant alternative for implementing field getters and setters.</li>
 * </ul>
 * If a method is not annotated with any of the above methods, it will be treated as if it was annotated
 * {@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Argument} using the next
 * unbound parameter index of the source method as its parameter. This means that a method
 * {@code Qux#baz(@Argument(2) Object p1, Object p2, @Argument(0) Object p3} would be treated as if {@code p2} was annotated
 * with {@code @Argument(1)}.
 * <p>&nbsp;</p>
 * In addition, the {@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.RuntimeType}
 * annotation can instruct a parameter to be bound by a
 * {@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign.Assigner} with considering the
 * runtime type of the parameter.
 * <p>&nbsp;</p>
 * <span style="text-decoration: underline">Selecting among different methods that can be used for binding a method
 * of the instrumented type</span>
 * <p>&nbsp;</p>
 * When deciding between two methods {@code Foo#bar} and {@code Foo#qux} that could both be used to delegating a
 * method call, the following consideration is applied in the given order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.BindingPriority}:
 * A method that is annotated with this annotation is given a specific priority where the default priority is set
 * to {@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.BindingPriority#DEFAULT}
 * for non-annotated method. A method with a higher priority is considered a better target for delegation.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.DeclaringTypeResolver}:
 * If a target method is declared by a more specific type than another method, the method with the most specific
 * type is bound.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.MethodNameEqualityResolver}:
 * If a source method {@code Baz#qux} is the source method, it will rather be assigned to {@code Foo#qux} because
 * of their equal names. Similar names and case-insensitive equality are not considered.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.ArgumentTypeResolver}:
 * The most specific type resolver will consider all bindings that are using the
 * {@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.Argument}
 * annotation for resolving a binding conflict. In this context, the resolution will equal the most-specific
 * type resolution that is performed by the Java compiler. This means that a source method {@code Bar#baz(String)}
 * will rather be bound to a method {@code Foo#bar(String)} than {@code Foo#qux(Object)} because the {@code String}
 * type is more specific than the {@code Object} type. If two methods are equally adequate by their parameter types,
 * then the method with the higher numbers of {@code @Argument} annotated parameters is considered as the better
 * delegation target.</li>
 * <li>{@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.ParameterLengthResolver}:
 * If a target methods has a higher number of total parameters that were successfully bound, the method with
 * the higher number will be considered as the better delegation target.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Additionally, if a method is annotated by
 * {@link net.bytebuddy.implementation.bind.annotation.IgnoreForBinding},
 * it is never considered as a target for a method delegation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Important</b>: For invoking a method on another instance, use the {@link MethodCall} implementation. A method delegation
 * intends to bind a interceptor class and its resolution algorithm will not necessarily yield a delegation to the intercepted
 * method.
 * </p>
