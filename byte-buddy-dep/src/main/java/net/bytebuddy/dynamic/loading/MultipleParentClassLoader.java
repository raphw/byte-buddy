/**
 * <p>
 * This {@link java.lang.ClassLoader} is capable of loading classes from multiple parents. This class loader
 * implicitly defines the bootstrap class loader to be its direct parent as it is required for all class loaders.
 * This can be useful when creating a type that inherits a super type and interfaces that are defined by different,
 * non-compatible class loaders.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note</b>: Instances of this class loader can have the same class loader as its parent multiple times,
 * either directly or indirectly by multiple parents sharing a common parent class loader. By definition,
 * this implies that the bootstrap class loader is {@code #(direct parents) + 1} times a parent of this class loader.
 * For the {@link java.lang.ClassLoader#getResources(java.lang.String)} method, this means that this class loader
 * might return the same url multiple times by representing the same class loader multiple times.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Important</b>: This class loader does not support the location of packages from its multiple parents. This breaks
 * package equality when loading classes by either loading them directly via this class loader (e.g. by subclassing) or
 * by loading classes with child class loaders of this class loader.
